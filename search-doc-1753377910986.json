Yet it still fails to deliver on concrete business topics. At Ekimetrics we strive to transfer AI innovations into the business world and Reinforcement Learning is a unbelievable playground to find disruptive solutions to complex real-world problems. In particular, there are many optimization problems that could be solved using RL. The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) has been solved for many years and used for tons of real-life situations including optimizing deliveries or network routing. This article will show a simple framework to apply Q-Learning to solving the TSP, and discuss the pros &amp; cons with other optimization techniques. It's a perfect introduction for beginners in Reinforcement Learning and does not require heavy computational capabilities. You can find all the code open sourced here on Github The Traveling Salesman Problem​ The Traveling Salesman Problem (or TSP) is a typical optimization problem, where one has to find the shortest route to visit different cities. There are many different ways to solve this problem using discrete optimization techniques. Like many optimization problems, it's a NP-hard problem, which in short means that it's easy (in terms of speed) to solve for 5 cities, already impossible to brute force for 50. And almost impossible for most algorithms for 5,000 cities. Even for 15 cities, it's already 1 trillion permutations to compute (15!), there are optimization techniques that are more adequate : dynamic programming, branch and bound algorithms, nearest neighbors approximations, or ant colonies optimizations. Furthermore, the problem described here is too simple to describe a real-life delivery situation. It does not take into account multiple vehicle fleet, electric vehicle charging, time window constraints, capacity constraints, aleatory perturbations, etc... Hence, each variant of the TSP has its own optimization frameworks (in terms of variables and constriants), and the more you complexify the problem, the more difficult it is of course. That's why in practice delivery companies use combinations of those variants coupled with heuristics. The most advanced companies today add Machine Learning techniques on top of those algorithms, in particular to replace manual heuristics and better estimate in-context durations. In Python, the easiest way to get started with TSP and its variants is probably the great open source library OR-Tools by Google. And if you want to learn more about discrete optimization, I can only recommend the great MOOC on Discrete Optimization by the University of Melbourne you can find on Coursera. Applying Reinforcement Learning to the TSP​ Why bother using Reinforcement Learning?​ If it's already solved by classical optimization techniques, why bother using Reinforcement Learning? Well several answers: It's fun and I personally love practicing RL. Curiosity is a great driver for innovation, and here I was really wondering if it could be applied for such a problem.RL is rarely used in real-life problems. Playing games or manipulating robot hands is awesome, but when it comes to business problems, RL often fails compared to simple heuristics or algorithms. At Ekimetrics, we always look for applying state-of-the-art AI research to the business problems we encounter in the real-world. However, Reinforcement Learning (in theory) would hold many advantages compared to classical optimization techniques : Offering a general framework for all problems, indeed instead of tweaking the constraints and defining extra variables, you can change the reward, and defining a multi agent problem if needed for fleet optimization. Adding extra information like delivery time estimation is also eased if you can integrate the prediction algorithm with a similar ML techniques (e.g. Neural Networks)Having a &quot;live&quot; decision making algorithm. Because you would train a RL alorithm by making the next delivery decision at each stop, compared to &quot;offline&quot; optimization algorithms that study the problem with no unknowns, you inherently would be able to take different decisions if something happened during the experience, whereas you would need to recalculate with classical techniquesBeing robust to unknowns and aleatory perturbations Transforming the TSP to a RL problem​ Before jumping into the TSP variants, let's take the most simplest version: a delivery man who has to deliver 50 packages. Between each stop can be defined a distance or a duration (or a more complex metric). To transform it to a RL problem, we need to define: Agent: the delivery manEnvironment: the different packages to deliver (and their destination) and the city where to navigateStates: the location where the delivery guy currently stops Actions: at each location, the decisions to make (modeled as a Markov process) are: &quot;where to go next&quot; (or &quot;which location do I chose next&quot;)Reward: Between two locations (states), how long (or how far) it is Creating the routing environment​ Creating a simple version of the environment is quite simple in pure Python. Indeed, you can store the position of the stops in a 2D virtual world as a numpy array or a Pandas DataFrame. Distances between stops can be calculated with an euclidean distance, but it could be complexified to account for durations or represent any distance/duration metric you would see in a routing network. from scipy.spatial.distance import cdist ENV_SIZE = 10 N_STOPS = 100 # Creating the stops using numpy random points generator xy = np.random.rand(N_STOPS,2)*ENV_SIZE # Computing the distances between each points # Here use euclidean distances, but any metric would do # This distance matrix can actually represent a time, a distance or something else distance_matrix = cdist(xy,xy) Then we want to define the starting position, the route, and the end position. Meaning that if we have to traverse A, B, C, D, E, possible routes would be for example A-&gt;C-&gt;B-&gt;E-&gt;D or B-&gt;D-&gt;E-&gt;C-&gt;A. By the way with 5 stops you have 5! possible routes or 120 possible routes. For 10 stops you already have 3.6 million possible routes. For 100 stops it's 10 to the 158th power routes. It's called the combinatory explosion, and that explains why this simple problem is impossible to brute force for a high number of stops. We can visualize routes by drawing lines between each stop We can also already imagine more complex and realistic situations. For example, one experiment I wanted to do was to stress test the RL algorithm to aleatory events. For example a known environment with unknown perturbations, like traffic. To model this interaction, we add a &quot;traffic zone&quot; inside our environment, where routes are much slower if taken. To account for the extra duration, we calculate the intersection points of the route within the &quot;traffic zone&quot; and measure the distance of the formed segment, we then use that distance weighed with a traffic intensity factor. i1,i2 = intersections distance_traffic = np.sqrt((i2[1]-i1[1])**2 + (i2[0]-i1[0])**2) additional_reward = distance_traffic * traffic_intensity * np.random.rand() Now that we have the overal idea, we have to design an environment object in Python to be fed to a Reinforcement Learning agent. We use the typical design framework inspired from OpenAI Gym: class DeliveryEnvironment: def reset(self): &quot;&quot;&quot;Restart the environment for experience replay Returns the first state &quot;&quot;&quot; pass def step(self,a): &quot;&quot;&quot;Takes an action in a given state Returns: s_next: the next state reward: the reward for such action done: if the simulation is done &quot;&quot;&quot; pass def render(self): &quot;&quot;&quot;Visualize the environment state &quot;&quot;&quot; pass Designing the Q-Learning algorithm​ Before jumping into complex Deep Learning, I wondered if a simple Q-Learning framework would work. Basically with Q-Learning you want to evaluate a matrix mapping states, actions and rewards. Indeed to make a decision in a given state about the best actions to do, you would love to have an estimate if the decision was the best in the long term. This is represented by the Q values. In our case, the rows are the different states (all the stops) and the columns the possible actions to take in this state, hence the next stop to go. The values are the estimated long-term reward you would get by taking this action. So, if you are found in a state A, you would like to take the action with the maximum Q value. For our TSP problem for example, we would have a Q-Matrix of 50 by 50 if we have 50 stops. Because we want to inform the routing algorithm with as much unbiased data we can find, we can actually initalize the Q matrix (also called Value function because it maps out states and actions to rewards - the values) with the distance matrix between all stops. Indeed, if you would not consider a long-term decision making strategy, you would apply a greedy one where you would chose the closest stop as a next destination. Yet it would definetely be better than random. from scipy.spatial.distance import cdist Q = cdist(xy,xy) Ok, but how to update those values and incorporate long-term planning? This is exactly the goal of the Q-Learning algorithm. Imagine you are delivering pizzas every day all across the city, you have an old GPS to help you decide the shortest route between your stops. But your city is much more complicated than what you and your GPS know. What would happen? The first day, you would chose the closest stop first and then jump to the next closest one. You will quickly realize that it's not optimized. You should maybe have gone first to another neighborhood and deliver everything in the area before jumping to another one. So the next day, you commit to another strategy, armed with yesterday's experience. Definitely, looking ahead and avoiding single deliveries in remote areas even if they are closest is a better idea. But while you are exploring the best routes, you pass through the city center and get blocked into traffic that terribly slows you down. The 3rd day, you will try to apply the same general strategy, but definitely if possible you will never go through the city center, and try circling around the city to save some precious time. This trial-and-error behavior is basically how experience replay works in the Reinforcement Learning framework. If we code an agent abstraction, it could look like this: class QAgent(Agent): def __init__(self,states_size,actions_size,epsilon = 1.0, epsilon_min = 0.01,epsilon_decay = 0.999,gamma = 0.95,lr = 0.8): self.states_size = states_size self.actions_size = actions_size self.epsilon = epsilon self.epsilon_min = epsilon_min self.epsilon_decay = epsilon_decay self.gamma = gamma self.lr = lr self.Q = self.build_model(states_size,actions_size) def build_model(self,states_size,actions_size): Q = np.zeros([states_size,actions_size]) return Q def train(self,s,a,r,s_next): self.Q[s,a] = self.Q[s,a] + self.lr * (r + self.gamma*np.max(self.Q[s_next,a]) - self.Q[s,a]) if self.epsilon &gt; self.epsilon_min: self.epsilon *= self.epsilon_decay def act(self,s): q = self.Q[s,:] if np.random.rand() &gt; self.epsilon: a = np.argmax(q) else: a = np.random.randint(self.actions_size) return a The most important line is this one: self.Q[s,a] = self.Q[s,a] + self.lr * (r + self.gamma*np.max(self.Q[s_next,a]) - self.Q[s,a]) This is the update rule in basic Q-Learning, where you increment the Q-value for each action in each experience replay (simulating a day of delivery hundreds of time) by the current reward + the reward for the best possible action you would take in the future. This recursive equation is a variation of the famous Bellman equation for Q value functions. Notice two factors: The learning rate lr control the learning speed (like in Deep Learning)The gamma factor gamma is the discount factor, and control long-term planning. Indeed if gamma = 0, you will only get the next action reward (your agent is &quot;short sighted&quot; only seeking current rewards), if gamma = 1 you will be more oriented towards the future rewards (above 1 it may diverge) Those two factors are our most important hyperparameters to tune during training (there are others like the epsilon variables defined in the initialization, if you are curious take a look at epsilon-greedy methods, a super simple way of tackling the exploration-exploitation dilemma in Reinforcement Learning) Writing the training loop​ Once we have define the environment, the Q-Agent and the update rules for the value function, we only need the final step: the training loop. We will apply experience replay to our poor delivery guy stucked in an infinite time loop. Every day, over and over, he will try to deliver our 50 packages, find the best routes and do it all over the next day. In Reinforcement Learning we call each day an episode, where we simply: Reset the environmentMake a decision of the next state to go toRemember the reward gained by this decision (minimum duration or distance elapsed)Train our agent with this knowledgeMake the next decision until all stops are traversed def run_episode(env,agent,verbose = 1): s = env.reset() agent.reset_memory() max_step = env.n_stops episode_reward = 0 i = 0 while i &lt; max_step: # Remember the states agent.remember_state(s) # Choose an action a = agent.act(s) # Take the action, and get the reward from environment s_next,r,done = env.step(a) # Tweak the reward r = -1 * r if verbose: print(s_next,r,done) # Update our knowledge in the Q-table agent.train(s,a,r,s_next) # Update the caches episode_reward += r s = s_next # If the episode is terminated i += 1 if done: break return env,agent,episode_reward Results​ Q-Learning for a simple TSP​ When you start training and experiencing the same problem overtime, your agent learns about the environment, this is shown by the episode rewards values for each experience replay. In the first phase, until the 400th episode, you are still exploring the different routes. Indeed with the epsilon decay method (with epsilon_decay=0.999), you are taking random actions at each step. In the second phase, epsilon is lowering, and you start exploiting what you have learnt, and take less and less random actions to be more driven by Q values. What's tricky with epsilon-greedy methods, is that it kind of forces of the convergence. So did it work? Let's see. 50 stops experiment​ 100 stops experiment​ 500 stops experiment​ In each experiment, the algorithm converges quite fast to a seamingly acceptable route. After exploring a lot of options it not only gives one route but variations of the accepted strategy, which can already be interesting to find alternatives. Q-Learning for a TSP with traffic zones​ Now that we have our environment, agent and framework defined, what's great with RL is that we don't have to change anything but the reward to model a different situation. Indeed because we tweaked the reward when you drove through a traffic zone, the agent will learn the same way to optimize his holistic route. 100 stops experiment with traffic zones​ Eureka, the agent will avoid as much as possible the traffic zones 500 stops experiment with traffic zones​ With more points, it's even more interesting, the agent will really circle around the traffic zone and prefer longer but faster routes. Next steps​ I hope this simple experiment has highlighted how to apply (non-Deep Learning) Reinforcement Learning techniques to real-life problems. I haven't had time to benchmark the resolution against other optimization techniques (which I should have done I confess), but let's try to draw some pros and cons for the approach. ⛔ Cons:​ Probably slowerDefinitely less accurate than a discrete optimization technique ✅ Pros:​ General framework to be updated in real-life situations (eg: the traffic) and extended to more complex problemsAlternative routes are proposed&quot;Online&quot; decision making (meaning that you have an algorithm armed with a next-best decision recommendation system) Next steps is to extend the work to an even more global framework to account for multiple vehicle fleets, charging stations and more. The latter idea will require to use Deep Reinforcement Learning because states could not be represented as a matrix, and will probably be more difficult (impossible?) to train, but that's a topic for a next article!

Methods for analyzing these online interactions have improved in sophistication and depth of insight offered in recent years meaning many traditional methods, such as journey mapping now fall short. Exploring Customer Journeys, whilst more complex, offers brands the opportunity to dive deeper and obtain more granular insights that can then be used to optimise and improve the experience of future customers. Employing advanced methodologies is not only beneficial, but it has also become a necessary action for any business that wants to explore the increasingly complex customer journeys possible on modern websites. To provide some context to this challenge - when investigating this possibility for one of our clients, a global leader in the telecom industry, we quickly realized that given the number of possible actions on their website (about 1,760), performing standard analysis would be overwhelming. It would, in fact, raise the number of potential journeys to something of the order of 104900. To put this number into perspective, the number of atoms in the universe is of the order of 10100. A simple method of analysing customer journeys is mapping. Essentially creating a visual representation of every touchpoint your customers have with you, creating a fluid timeline from how you initially engaged them to their first purchase and tracking the ongoing relationship. … it would raise the number of possible journeys to something of the order of 104900. To put this number into perspective, the number of atoms in the universe is of the order of 10100. Advancing methodologies - Creating groups of similar journeys through image embedding, autoencoders and unsupervised learning​ Many businesses are adapting strategic models to emphasise customer-centricity and build up their online presence. Websites, therefore, become a powerful asset in understanding customer behaviour through the data that they generate. And analyzing this data becomes a potential source of insight to improve future interactions with the customer base, driving loyalty and higher conversion. Journey mapping and other traditional methods can provide fast and high-level customer insight, which can be an important first step in making use of this asset. However, they often fall short as the numbers of potential journeys increase exponentially. Journey clustering is a more advanced approach that uses algorithms to analyse all journeys by identifying groups of customers who interact with the website in similar ways. In doing so, we identify patterns in customer behaviour and begin to understand the motivations behind their actions. This type of analysis can be used by businesses to personalise their websites and improve customer experience. Ekimetrics' innovative approach specifically uses advanced encoding and machine learning methods, as well as clustering algorithms to make sense of the complex digital world. To address this challenge our approach requires three key steps: Reducing the dimensions of our customer journey dataset Creating image-like representations of customer journeys; one image represents one customer journey Applying clustering algorithms on images to create groups of users with similar behaviours. For each cluster, we are then able to define a “standard journey”. Step 1: Reducing the dimensions of our dataset​ Analyzing customer journeys is a difficult task that can lead to memory allocation errors, primarily due to high data diversity. Even for less sophisticated brands, the number of parameters feeding into a customer journey analysis model can quickly become unmanageable due to the sheer size of data needing to be analysed. For example, the following features can be tracked: the URL of the pages visited, time spent on one page, overall duration on the website, user clicks, and many more. The temptation is to add as much detail as possible, but more variables create more noise and lengthening computation time. A solution to this problem is to identify the most relevant variables - with respect to the business question we want to answer - to take forward through feature selection, these metrics can then be aggregated into a single data structure. This process serves two purposes: firstly reducing the size and complexity of our inputs and ensuring the outputs are directed towards the business objectives and free of unnecessary noise. Step 2: Encoding and creating images to represent journeys​ Customer Journeys are path-dependent processes that describe customers’ interactions with different touchpoints, for example, all actions on a website leading up to purchase. To analyse these relationships we need to manipulate datasets to represent online journeys but also translate them into something that can be easily interpreted and modelled. To do this and ensure no information is lost we create a 3D embedding ‘image’ that merges all this data into a single structure through the following processes: Touchpoints that a customer has interacted with are represented in columns The order in which interactions happen is represented in rows A vector describing the quality of the customer interaction (e.g. time spent/number of clicks…) Building our 3D embedding through an iterative process The 3 parts for building our 3D embedding highlighted in the figure above are: Given n, the number of possible interactions on the platform, it is possible to build a vector V=(1,n) representing all actions that a customer can perform. At a particular stage t, it is possible to fill V with “0“ or “1” depending on the customer’s action: if the ith action has been performed at stage t, set V(1,i)=1 , otherwise V(1,i)=0 It is then possible to replicate this process at every stage of the customer’s journey in order to build a matrix M(l,n) where every line l represents the lth action performed by the customer Finally, adding an indicator of the journey’s quality consists of replacing the 0 &amp; 1 in the previous matrix, with a vector of values describing the interactions. Example of an image decomposition through RGB channels note Colourized pictures can be decomposed into Red, Green and Blue monochromatic sub-pictures. In our case, we can draw a parallel between the different indicators describing the interactions and the colourized levels of an image. Step 3: Clustering customer journey “images” to identify standard paths​ In order to apply a clustering algorithm first, we had to clean and apply pre-processing to our data. We then had to control the dimensions in order to keep the number of variables below a defined threshold (we chose ~log #observations). To achieve such control we used autoencoder neural networks. The goal of such algorithm is to learn a semantic representation by extracting the relevant signals from a given set of observations. This is a dimension reduction method that enables us to perform non-linear transformations. In other words autoencoders enable us to turn our inputs into meaningful and compressed data by getting rid of the non relevant information. info PCA is another such dimension reduction method that performs linear transformations. Using a convolutional autoencoder to compress customer journeys The above figure shows how an autoencoder performs on a dimension reduction problem. First, the input signal is compressed over the blue layers to reach a compressed representation (represented by the Dense layer). The signal is reconstructed using the green layers to then give the output. The goal is to have similar inputs and outputs while controlling the size of the Dense layer. The above architecture is different from the classic convolutional autoencoders (classic autoencoders involve a succession of convolution and pooling layers for the encoding part, and upsampling layers for the decoding part). The architecture we used relies on convolution layers, and on deconvolution layers rather than upsampling ones. Since deconvolution layers are trainable (meaning that they depend on learnable parameters), and upsampling ones are not, this architecture can learn more complex transformations than a classic convolutional autoencoder of the same depth. This architecture is inspired from the one described in this article about Deep Clustering. Once we had completed the dimension reduction, we need to apply a clustering solution on the compressed customer journeys. We then assigned each group of similar customer journeys to a representative standard journey. A word about clustering A clustering process consists of building groups of observations (e.g. customer journeys) based on their characteristics. The key components of the clustering process are: Building groups containing similar observations: we talk about intra-class variance minimization.Building groups that are different from each other: we talk about inter-class variance maximization. Clustering tasks rely on unlabelled data (such learning tasks are known as ‘unsupervised learning’). Making the customer journey analysis easier to perform - taking advantage of a reduced number of journeys​ Performing a clustering algorithm on Customer Journeys aims to reduce the complexity of the analysis through the creation of groups with similar journeys. The analysis is easier to perform as it becomes possible to focus only on the representations of each group, instead of analyzing every single path. This method drastically reduces the number of journeys that require our attention. It also becomes possible to highlight complex similarities or patterns when creating these clusters. info Once the clusters are created, each of them is assigned to a standard journey (e.g. when using k-means, these standard journey are called centroids). Example of standard journeys The example above shows three of these standard journeys. We can already see some interesting information and differences between the clusters: Customers in the Standard journey #1 group complete more actions compared to #2 and #3. All three standard journeys have different starting and ending pages that correspond to the first and last rows in the pictures). By looking at these standard journeys, at a glance we can already spot some initial differences between the clusters. Note that deeper analyses can be performed on these journeys by looking at the non-embedded data. Leveraging the Customer Journey Clustering - three ways of improving customer-centric strategy​ We believe that this solution has several uses to improving the way businesses operate by better understanding customer behaviour, forming a stronger view of the customer lifetime value, and improving the user experience and conversion rate. Improving websites​ We can use customer journey clustering to build a representative journey (using the centroid of each cluster), establishing the usual actions a user performs between touchpoint A (e.g. website’s homepage) and touchpoint B (e.g. website’s purchasing page). These typical journeys help gain a better understanding of the customers’ experiences, allowing us to identify ways to improve the website. For example, it will help brands optimise the groups of products shown at the top of a landing page. Building audiences​ By understanding the size and similarities between groups that interact with our website Customer Journey Clustering is also a way to create specific audiences. It then allows brands to tailor their activity to engage with these specific audiences, improving the overall experience. For example, if clusters 1 and 2 appear similar, but cluster 1 has a higher conversion rate than cluster 2, then analyzing the behaviours from cluster 1 may help us understand how to better retarget cluster 2. These insights also make it possible to redirect customers through an optimal action that will drive more conversions. note We could go a step further by creating customer conversion scores based on their journey. These scores could then be used to build an optimized communication strategy, leading to the next optimal action (i.e. increase or reduce media spend, depending on the score). Improve churn prediction​ Another use case to Customer Journey clustering is evaluating churn and when customers are likely to shop with a competitor or stop ordering from us. When journeys are associated to a churn score, it becomes possible to create a predictive model that can be used to identify the groups that are more inclined to churn. Following the training of the model, the learnings could be applied to the standard journeys associated with each cluster, outputting a global churn score per cluster. These scores can then be evaluated and compared to other groups to better manage expected orders and improve communications with at-risk customers. note Since a churn predictive model such as this is trained on the 3D embedded customer journeys, one can expect it to be capable of spotting complex churn patterns involving huge sequences of actions, or time spent per action. Conclusion​ At Ekimetrics we believe that customer journey clustering can help enhance the customer experience and increase customer lifetime value. We also know that with customer behaviours changing rapidly, an approach such as this provides a flexible solution that can translate into actionable insights for any business. However, complexity is not always the answer. A good model should tell a compelling and comprehensive story, but increased complexity must be accompanied by an effort to improve interpretability and should showcase enhanced benefits for business application. The customer journey is still a challenge for every business globally. We do believe that there is no « plug and play » answer and each solution needs to be built for the problem at hand. For us, intelligent data science means developing integrated approaches and leveraging different methods to help make brighter business decisions. Appendix​ To give you more details, if we take an example where a user can perform up to 10 different actions on a website, the number of possible journeys is 9,864,100. info Given n the number of possible interactions, the number of possible journeys is given by the sum from 1 to n of the number of permutation of n.

With Automated Machine Learning (Auto ML) however, it can take days at most for business professionals &amp; Data Scientists alike to develop and compare dozens of models, find insights and solve business problems quickly. But what is AutoML, how does it work and what are the most popular AutoML solutions out there? In this article, we will introduce the field of Automated Machine Learning by exploring some popular AutoML frameworks and trying to answer those questions around how to make the right choice for your use case. What is AutoML and why it is interesting?​ Definition​ Sebastian Raschka, a well regarded American statistics professor, states: ‘’Computer programming is about automation, and Machine Learning is all about automating automation’’. If that’s true then we can say that Automated Machine Learning is the automation of automating automation..! AutoML is a new optimization technique which aims at automating some of the core - but highly iterative - parts of the traditional modelling process in ML, in particular feature selection and model selection (including hyperparameter tuning and stacking). Let’s take the example of a Decision Tree Algorithm. This algorithm has many hyperparameters (leaf, depth, split etc.) and browsing through all those hyperparameters can take days. An AutoML algorithm can intelligently explore all the possible parameters in order to find the best possible ML algorithm solving a given task. Some advanced AutoML algorithms can even choose between different features, create new ones and try different data cleansing scenarios! How AutoML can help us?​ There are many steps in a Machine Learning project, with Model Training typically being one of the most time consuming. A standard project will focus on a Business Problem and will pass through Data Collection, Cleaning and Processing before the training phase. Model Training can then be cumbersome as we have to select an appropriate model family and to fine tune many times differents hyperparameters before building the analysis and deploying the model. This process can take weeks or months, but it seems that several steps can be automated using optimization algorithms and that is the goal of auto ML. In a sense, AutoML is seen as a way to increase productivity, to allow the Data Scientist to focus more on defining the problem and the analyses rather than the models finetuning, to help avoiding errors, and on top of that, to democratize Machine Learning so that everyone can leverage its power. Its integration within ML Engineering environment allows to streamline pipeline and integrate specific training jobs, that allows to parametrize a model search completely from a simple configuration file. Overview of the main AutoML frameworks in the market​ For this article, we have selected 7 well known AutoML frameworks, but many more exist in the market. Below is an overview of some of the types of Data Science problems these AutoML solutions can address. Among them two are open source: AutoKeras &amp; H2o and the others are not: with DataRobot, Dataiku, Azure, GCP, and AWS SageMaker. (2 other open-source solutions AutoKeras and AutoGluon were studied, but these frameworks are not available on Windows.) Many of the AutoML solutions address different types of Data Science problems such as Sentiment Analysis or Computer Vision, however what is going to interest us for the rest of is article are the Classification and Regression ML problems. Exploring the capabilities of several AutoML solutions​ Our methodology (Classification/Regression, datasets Kaggle)​ The purpose here is to bring some knowledge in the field of Automated Machine Learning by exploring some popular AutoML frameworks. In order to establish a performance benchmark, we decided to test those frameworks on common ML topics like Regression and Classification. The idea is also to share our personal experience (and difficulties encountered) with those tools so that everyone can have an overview of each one these AutoML solutions. These packages were benchmarked on two classical datasets available on Kaggle. We chose the Titanic Challenge (Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster | Kaggle) for the Classification problem and the House Prices Challenge (House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques | Kaggle) for the Regression problem. For each framework, we submitted predictions on the test set on Kaggle so that we can compare the results to the general leaderboard. What is interesting with this approach is that we were able to compare performance not only between each AutoML solution but also with individual performance. Our results​ Classification Problem - Titanic Challenge​ The Titanic Challenge is one of the most famous on Kaggle with more than 30,000 challengers. The objective is to have a model which will predict if a Titanic passenger survives or not on a small data set with 9 features and around 900 rows in the training set. The metric used for this challenge is the accuracy and the leaderboard we have downloaded from Kaggle is provided below. Each point represents a challenger with the performance of all tested frameworks noted, with ranking &amp; accuracy plotted on the x and y axis. We found that Azure has the best accuracy followed by H2O and that the accuracy for all frameworks ranges within 73% - 80%. Regression Problem - House Prices Challenge​ For the House Prices Challenge, the goal is to predict the final price of residential homes in the United States. This time the metric is the root mean squared error, which is a metric that tells us the average distance between the predicted values from the model and the actual values in the dataset. We have around 8000 challengers (less challengers than the Titanic Challenge) and the dataset here is bigger with more than 250 features and around 1400 rows in the training set. We can see that all frameworks did better than the baseline RMSE. Each of the tested models fall between 0.24 - 0.12 in terms of the RSME and H2O again performs the best among other tested frameworks. Conclusion​ Which AutoML solutions to choose?​ In conclusion, which AutoML to choose? When making our decision, the framework performance is important, but not all frameworks were in fact easy to use. Conversely, we spent a lot of time on some frameworks, because some of them were not as intuitive as expected. User friendliness must also therefore be a major criterion to consider when you are wondering which AutoML to use. That’s why, in order to consider the frameworks performance on both the Kaggle challenge but also the user friendliness of each solution (if it is easy to install it, to get familiar with the tool, to set up the experiment without errors), we built two further metrics to evaluate each AutoML framework and to compare them. On the x-axis: we give the ease of use for each AutoML framework from 1 to 10 (10 being the best) On the y-axis: we took the average ranking on the both Kaggle challenge (the closer to 0, the better) The metric 'ease of use' is somewhat subjective as it refers to our own personal experience. However, we would add that one of the goals of AutoML is to make Machine Learning accessible to everyone, so for someone with very little knowledge, it is interesting to see how accessible the differents tools are. We found that: The cloud solutions are more difficult to master especially if you’ve never used cloud computing before. In fact, some time is needed to get familiar with all the different functionalities of cloud solutions like Azure, AWS or GCP as there are powerful and comprehensive tools. Dataiku and DataRobot are very easy to use and very visual, with many icons. These interfaces are very clear and simple. If you want to use an extremely easy-to-use AutoML tool, which can perform automated machine learning very quickly, DataRobot and Dataiku seem to be good solutions. H2O works as a notebook so if you are familiar working on a Jupyter notebook for example, it can definitely be a good option and not too painful to use. H2O seems to be a very good choice in terms of performance and ease of use. Moreover, this framework has the advantage of being completely open source. Final thoughts, our key takeaways​ This article tries to compare 7 majors AutoML frameworks. To do so, we introduced a methodology that considers the performance of each solution, but also their ease of use. What appears clearl is that AutoML can definitely be a good starting point to an ML project. In fact, for both the Classification and Regression problem, all the frameworks performed almost as well, even better sometimes than the baseline, just by using the AutoML functionality. However, it is important to remember that automatically generated pipelines are still very basic and are not able to beat human experts yet. As we could see on the different benchmarks from Kaggle, Data Scientists still perform better. A Data Scientist analyzes the hidden information inside data, extracts useful correlations, gives useful insights about the business that has created data itself and all these tasks cannot be fully automated.

Here is why, and why you should join us","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"blog/2022/02/09/ekimetrics_implements_data_mesh","content":"Introduction​ Ekimetrics’ approach to data management starts from prioritized data use-cases, vision for architecture and vision for organization. Although the vision for architecture is tailored to the culture of every customer, it is inspired by the practices we see as inspiring. This article describes one of these inspirational patterns that drive our projects’ data architectures, the Data Mesh. I must introduce Ekimetrics first, we are 320 data scientists, with people and projects in Europe, in the US and in Asia. The goal of Ekimetrics is to become the most trusted partner in data science for business. Every consultant has their preferred topics: Vertical business expertise is the most represented, which is nice because that’s where we derive use-cases from, then statistics / ml / advanced algorithms, then, equally represented, product development and data architecture and engineering. With a couple of colleagues, I lead that data architecture and engineering practice. Data Mesh is a new framework that emerged recently, it is so deep and wide that we believe that it has the potential to influence data management for a whole decade. The foundational papers, by Zhamak Dehghani (zhamakd) in 2019 are nothing short of fantastic (see articles How to Move Beyond a Monolithic Data Lake to a Distributed Data Mesh and Data Mesh Principles and Logical Architecture). They address real-life challenges, they indicate how architectural and organizational aspects can be worked together and they really bring a new energy in data management. So, while I will cherry-pick some of the data mesh ideas that we are implementing today, I strongly encourage you to read both articles thoroughly. Said differently, what I describe below is only what is closest to our mindset and to our maturity on the projects, but there are many more insights in the original papers. What is data mesh?​ Data Mesh is a nice way to organize and grow data assets that serve business purposes. Data Mesh takes a limited number of simple ideas for data management, and all the terms used below are described in detail in the two foundational articles: Ownership of data should be within the hands of the business teams, Data boundaries should be created along business boundaries for data security, data sharing, cost management, etc., these are called Data Domains, Sharing datasets inside and possibly outside the company should be simple, Focusing on data products is a good approach to create value from data, Federated governance is an approach that will scale where other cannot, There is a harmonious way for IT, Data and Business teams to collaborate around data, We see Data Mesh as a holistic way to organize data management. And since some cloud vendors have managed services that can help organize data like that, we have been working in that direction successfully with many organizations. Who is data mesh for?​ We did not identify customer profiles where data mesh would not apply, so we believe it is ubiquitous. Medium and large organizations in financial services, retail, utilities, luxury, etc., both the references we have and the references we learn about prove it applies to all kind of companies. Limits are on the capability to challenge existing data assets and existing data culture, and it is not always the right moment to change these. That said, it should be possible to gradually transition from a monolithic data lake to a data mesh, by slowly introducing data domains. And a consultancy firm like Ekimetrics is the right place to be to participate in these changes ! What is the relationship with GCP, Synapse or Databricks?​ We see the latest generation of platforms is indeed very aligned with what data mesh requires, and GCP BigQuery, Azure Synapse and Databricks are good candidates for Data Mesh deployments. With GCP as an example, it is easy to separate the cost of the storage in one project and the cost of the processing in another project and it’s easy to leverage the data that one part of the company has prepared into a data product that is owned by another part of the company, without copying data, which is a data mesh idea. While this has been in BigQuery for a decade now, the framework now has a name! Such solutions can now be built with GCP, Synapse and Databricks.

It has challenged companies' Supply Chain operations and highlighted that most companies could improve their supply chain management. Therefore, generating demand for enhanced forecasting capabilities. In 2021, we had the opportunity to work with a French pioneer in manufacturing on this topic. We had to industrialize a solution for warehouse demand forecasting for more than 20,000 referenced products to improve overall Supply Chain performance. At the time, the existing solution was deprecated and not handling correctly erratic sales. Therefore, we had to create a new, more robust algorithm to help Operational Managers better allocate resources. This latter solution enabled a 60% accuracy improvement and was integrated into Operational Managers processes for decision making. An important asset for Supply Chain transformation​ Demand forecasting has an impact on different levers: Stock Management: forecasting can drastically improve Inventory Management. Underproducing means losing revenue opportunities, whilst overproducing means selling your products cheaper or facing additional storage costs. Furthermore, with the return of activity after the first lockdown, suppliers are now bearing the brunt of building sites recovery, causing delays and creating supply instability. Resource allocation: defining the best number of weekly working hours is not an easy task for operational managers, and anticipation is key to achieving optimal throughput. Product strategy: demand forecasting also supports better handling of specific trends and product lifecycle. Hence, it helps warehouses anticipate and meet high demands, detect declined products and help marketing teams better understand customers’ needs. Most importantly, Demand Forecasting has not become a hot topic because of the pandemic. Nevertheless, it brought to light the need of transforming Supply Chains and adapt to unexpected events. Indeed, global warming is increasing the frequency of natural disasters, which will test Supply Chains resilience (have you heard of our AI4S offer?). How to build Demand Forecasting tool​ What are we trying to solve?​ Framing the problem is key to ensuring Data Scientists go in the right direction. When discussing with Supply Chain managers, we understood they wanted to reduce their costs. Thus, improving resource allocation was the best lever to achieve their need. Clearly stating the business need allowed us to understand the problem and impacted the solution implementation. Build and assess model​ Because of the high number of products and their associated nomenclature, we used a decision tree algorithm (LightGBM). The business required a reliable mid-term forecasting tool within a short time lap and with limited team size, justifying the choice of a well-known and high-performance algorithm. Our solution is a 3-week forecasting tool with daily updates for all referenced products. The ML pipeline we have built for this project is similar to many existing ones. Therefore, we will focus on how the business problem framed our solution. Still, this project was an opportunity for us to use Kedro, which enabled Data Science teams to set up their ML data pipelines. Kedro had the advantage of visualizing your pipeline and structuring our code to ensure maintainability and reproducibility. Modelling target​ We want to optimize warehouse working hours to ensure clients satisfaction by delivering stores on time. What requires the most operational effort? Our client uses single order picking methods - meaning that pickers work on one order at a time. Thus, it is more time-consuming for a picker to prepare two orders of the same product rather than picking two times the product for the same order. Consequently, we focused on predicting the number of orders rather than the quantity ordered. NB: depending on how your supply chain operates, the modelling output would differ. Modelling granularity​ Our client had a complex product hierarchy, meaning products can be aggregated at different levels. Demand forecasting at a product level gives higher flexibility when used on various business use cases, albeit not being the optimal solution for each one. Therefore, we aggregated ordered products at a higher granularity, to find the best balance between modelling accuracy and business need. Working at a product level when having more than 20,000 products can be painful: it means working with sparse time series (which isn’t trivial when using decision trees) manufacturing companies often deal with products turnover (because products are frequently improved), meaning you may lose the thread of which product is getting improved. Therefore, to optimize resource allocation, it was relevant to build a forecasting tool at a product category level, to combine similar products and avoid dealing with product’s turnover. Analyzing sparsity at different granularities also helped us define the best modelling level. Distribution of products' sparsity (e.g. percentage of zeroes in orders). It is clear that most products have more than 90% of zeroes. Important learnings here were: Sparse time series are hard to predictIt is best to go for a solution where the unit (time x product x localization) of forecasting matches the unit of decision making We see how the coronavirus outbreak impacted the activity of our client during the first containment. Predicting this period is pretentious, but how can it help us reduce uncertainty in the future? Modelling loss function​ Modelling errors assess algorithms performance and help choose the model we will industrialize to better impact operations. However, when deploying a solution, we want to measure an error that reflects the current problem. Demand forecasting is not exclusively about being accurate on future demands but also about improving operations. Therefore, customizing errors metrics is a key part of machine learning development, allowing us to define the right balance between product demand (model accuracy) and product average preparation time. (focus on products with high preparation time). We implemented the Weighted Root Mean Squared Scaled Error, using product average revenues in the last 6 months and product average preparation time. Product B weekly preparation time is 400 min vs 200 min for Product A. Thus, higher accuracy on Product B is needed to reflect the operational needs. Evaluate business outcome​ Because predictions are not always (never) linked to business outcomes, it is important to differentiate outputs (what are the predictions?) from outcomes (how will it impact the business?). This part was not implemented during the project, but we will briefly explain the methodology to give you a flavour on how it could be done. Model accuracy is a technical metric, so to quantify our ML model impact on operations we also need to estimate the predicted number of working hours. Comparing the number of predicted working hours with the realized working hours would allow measuring how much the algorithm is reducing costs. Create a sustainable solution​ Implement a web app​ A core part of our solution was to implement an easy-to-use application for operations managers. It helped them access predictions in real-time, assess model past performance and define the optimal working hours needed. We used Streamlit for its ease of use and ability to create fast and intuitive applications whenever we are short on time. Consequently, we created a usable solution by communicating predictions, demand, and past errors at different granularities. Add a feedback loop​ Finally, we created a feedback loop to enable the team to maintain, improve and sustain the solution. This concept is well explained in Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence, a book about what AI means from an economist perspective. They introduce a great concept they have named the Anatomy of a Task. Predictions mainly impact people’s judgement and decisions taken for action. It implies that algorithms are rather helpful for decision-makers than make the actual choice. In our situation, the predictions enable operational managers to take action on the number of pickers needed in the coming weeks. Improving modelling should help these managers be more accurate in their decision process. Giving Data Science teams feedback on how modelling affected outcomes is the added value. Consequently, we decided to create a clear feedback process with the operational managers. We made sure we could improve our forecasting model in a business manner rather than a statistical one. Our model not being perfect, the operational team’s feedback on how our predictions are impacting their daily work will help us improve our algorithms and create a sustainable solution. Concluding and food for thought​ New challenges will arise, and data will help supply chains tackle them. Creating a data-driven culture is key to useful and sustainable solutions. Creating state-of-the-art models is great, but a successful data science transformation is about creating impactful projects and delivering value throughout. Thanks to this project, we learnt that: Demand Forecasting is a great entry to improve Supply Chain operations, but the impact will be limited if not embedded in the full Supply Chain environment. Demand forecasting is not about predicting the future, but about how data helps improve communication between teams.","keywords":"Data Science EkiLab Ekimetrics Eki.Lab Eki Machine Learning Artificial Intelligence Supply Chain Streamlit Demand Forecasting LightGBM Data Science for business"},{"title":"Newsletter for February 2022","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"blog/2022/02/28/newsletter_Feb-2022","content":"Data Science​ DeepMind presents AlphaCode, your next worst enemy in coding test​ Google’s AI subsidiary keeps a high publishing pace by presenting a new powerful programming tool.

The main challenge is not to create one, but rather to do it right and avoid falling into the so-called data swamp and empty shell traps. In this article, we’ll go through how you can create your first datalake following best practices in order to make it robust, evolutive and central to your company’s information architecture, as well as take advantage of the opportunities it presents. In this post, we’ll be technology agnostic. The focus here is a smart architecture that will help solve functional and technical challenges, whether you’re using Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, any other provider or even building &amp; managing the infrastructure yourself. Introduction​ Before talking about how to design a datalake, let’s review what it is, why it’s useful and the main aspects that will ensure its quality. What is a datalake?​ A datalake is a global storage space allowing to interact with all data type: unstructured (e.g. text documents, images, videos), semi-structured (e.g. XML / JSON files), structured (e.g. SQL tables, CSV files). Data is extracted from all relevant sources, loaded into the datalake, then transformed into their use case specific target. A well-designed datalake is flexible and scalable, allowing it to handle the increase in data volume, velocity, and variety. Because a datalake stores raw data before transforming it, it is extremely useful for extracting potential value from the data for the future. By centralizing data sources into a global storage space, it helps data scientists and analysts explore data to generate new use cases and business insights. Is building a datalake the right solution?​ The goal shouldn’t be to build a datalake for the sake of building one. A datalake is only the foundation, corner pieces in your larger data analytics and data architecture puzzle. Your goal should be to find a use case from which you can build a robust and evolutive foundation to your technical and functional architecture. Having a clear vision as to how your datalake can grow in a 2-year horizon, with new data sources and analytical use cases, is essential. The data swamp and empty shell traps​ Chasing the dream of a datalake that meets all current and future analytics needs or that unites all of your organization’s stakeholders around a single vision is an excellent way to fall into the data swamp or empty shell traps. By trying to collect all current – and future – data sources from the start, there is a risk that your datalake will become a swamp. When that’s the case, due to unorganized, unvalidated or simply hard to exploit data, it can be incredibly challenging to make your datalake useable. Your first goal should be to analyze which high impact use cases will be used by your organization’s stakeholders and target data for these specific use cases. Starting with the business needs instead of chasing a technical achievement, you can be sure that your datalake will be used and useful, instead of an empty shell: a good foundation but unable to attract your organization’s stakeholders. Read more about how we can avoid missing out on business impact in this whitepaper. The foundation architecture​ Let us first establish the building blocks of your datalake. This foundation is the basis for logical separation of your data and use cases in the platform you'll be building. A datalake can ingest any type of data: from structured tables to unstructured files, whether ingested by batch or through streaming processes. Data will transit through four zones in sequence, from its raw form to fully processed for use cases, and from a technical to a business orientation. Landing LAN : temporary zone for all sources. Once data is extracted, it transits through this zone and is dispatched into the next zone by validation mechanisms. RAW (also known as bronze): data extraction pipelines will fetch data in the landing zone and validate it technically as well as functionally to make sure it is usable. This zone is the main storage component for all your data, and contains every extracted source, raw and untransformed, only with a concern for what is technically and functionally usable. In landing and raw zone, data is organized logically by source: CRM, Point of Sales, WEB, etc. Trusted TRD (also known as silver): in this zone, you'll find the output of your data pipelines. Here, data is deduplicated, cleaned, transformed, and aggregated for your target use cases. Data is organized logically by data domain (Marketing, Finance, Sales, Operations…) and use case (Reporting, API exposition, AI training…). Refined RFD (also known as gold): this is the final zone for your data. It is the exposition layer for your use cases and is organized logically by use case. These four zones are a representation of your data's journey through the datalake. From the refined zone, a serving layer can be added, taking shape in data marts, APIs, file exposition, etc. Your apps and users can then fetch or be sent data through this serving layer and make decisions that will give your data value. Data’s journey through a datalake, from source to usage Your data’s journey from sources to serving layers is managed by pipelines, which are themselves managed by orchestrators. Pipelines describe how data is moved and transformed, be it with highly customized code or low code interfaces: in terms of concept, pipelines are close to ELTs (Extract, Load, Transform) mechanisms. Orchestrators are an ensemble of pipelines, defining parameters for each of them and specifying when and how they should be run: periodically, when an event triggers, using larger or smaller computing power, etc. note A sandbox storage zone and computing environment can be made available with access to some of your storage zones. That sandbox allows for exploration of data by data scientists and data analysts, motivating new use cases. Based on this architecture, it all seems too simple: find a high value use case to start off the building process, then add new use cases and sources later. Following the design principles in the next section, it could in fact be that simple, all the while avoiding falling into the data swamp and empty shell traps. Usable and Useful through architecture and design​ We’ve gathered some best practices and design principles that work well to counteract the possibility of your datalake becoming messy or unused. We like to think of each of these best practices as serving a goal that is threefold: building a datalake that is usable, useful, and used - what we refer to as our three “U”s. The first “U” is targeted towards the data swamp trap, the latter two towards the empty shell trap. Usable through clear storage and pipelines architecture​ The first step for building a usable datalake is to make your storage and pipelines easy to comprehend for users as well as automated processes. Technical and functional separation for pipelines and storage is your first step in making your datalake understandable. Make it clear who does what in the datalake. A use case is built on top of data, which needs to be collected: we’ve found it best to separate data collection from its transformation from the start. Using at least different pipelines, and, better still, different scheduler resources will make understanding who (or which pipeline) is doing what much easier. One orchestrator for data collection pipelines, and other orchestrators for each data domain and use case theme – e.g. finance reporting, marketing CRM, sales exposition... This also sets up your datalake’s functional architecture in a “data mesh”-like manner, where each data domain has its own identifiable perimeter. Separating pipelines among data domain orchestrators allows for a better understanding of who does what Make it obvious where to find data in your storage. We’ve talked a little about Landing, Raw, Trusted and Refined data storage layers. Separating your data by source in the Raw/Bronze layer will help your users and transformation pipelines identify each dataset. Separating transformed data by use case in the Trusted and Refined layers will give a better understanding of the functional architecture behind the storage. Make it apparent which transformation or collection pipelines is responsible for which data. Use identifiers such as date and time “YYYYMMDD_HHMM” for your pipelines and processes. Date and time is a great identifier for understanding when data was transformed or collected. Sticking to them for your logging as well, you can make sure that monitoring your pipelines and exploring their results is as easy as possible. Inside your transformation pipelines, we’ve found that using break points is highly useful. Writing a dataset’s state after it’s been cleaned, pre-transformed, etc… up until its final refined state will make debugging and understanding your pipelines much easier. Using names like 0_deduplicated, 1_cleaned, 2_calculated to show breakpoints in your transformations allow for a better understanding of the data lineage of each use case, also helping exploration in the sandbox. Usable through data validation​ Now that your storage and pipelines architecture is understandable, your second goal is to make your data usable so that the datalake doesn’t immediately become a swamp with faulty and unchecked data. One mistake to avoid is to consider that since a datalake can store any type of data, all data is good to collect, and you can figure out if it’s usable and useful later. On the contrary: validating data from the get-go is essential. By having your data collection pipelines look at the structure and content of the data, you can make sure that your transformation pipelines will have a smooth time reading it down the line. However, this does not mean that you instantly delete any data that is deemed unfit for your use cases. We’ve found that dispatching data into rejected and validated subzones in the RAW/bronze zone is a good option: A rejected subzone for any data that will not technically fit your use case pipelines: faulty files with bad lines, wrong column count for structured data, corrupt zip files, bad encoding, the list goes on. Deciding which data to move to the rejected subzone ultimately depends on how it will be read by later pipelines. We’ve also seen cases where data needs to be rejected for functional reasons: data from a source can be sent to you even though you’re not allowed to use it, or the data is technically readable but does not match with the sources you accept. In this instance, you can divide your rejected subzone into technical rejects and functional rejects. Finally, any data that is technically and functionally usable can transit to the validated subzone. When a use case pipeline reads data, it will usually only read that data’s validated zone. This not only ensures that your pipelines are robust and will not fail due to faulty or unexpected data, but it also allows for a stable data model to be built. Technical and functional data validation guarantee a first level of data quality Why keep rejected data, you’ll ask? Data that is technically rejected is useful for several reasons, the first one being that it is a good indicator of your sources' quality, and allows you to communicate efficiently with your data providers. Secondly, technically invalid data at one point in time may be usable in the future, be it by adjusting your later pipelines to be able to read them or simply correcting the data as a one-shot fix. Data that is functionally rejected is also useful, particularly in cases where it’s from a source you’re not sure you’re allowed to collect. An additional subzone can then be a quarantine zone, where you would store data for which you need to check whether you can accept it in your use cases. note By managing functional and technical rejections, your collection pipelines can be a powerful tool for your Data Steward and apply robust and monitorable governance at the datalake’s entry point. From validated sources to a specific breakpoint in a run ID of a Use Case in a domain Useful through a business driven design​ What we mean by “useful” - the second of our three “U”s, is that your datalake has to serve a business use, while not limiting itself to the first identified use cases. This in turn means several things. The first thing being the importance of starting from a business use case to then identify which data must be collected and transformed. Working from the business needs is always the winning strategy, especially for data science and datalake projects where it is easy to get lost in all the possibilities. Collecting data into your datalake is not an effortless task, especially following the aforementioned tips that help validate the data’s usability, functionally and technically. Which is why the first step is to make sure that the data you collect is indeed useful to your target use case. Our article “Customer Data Platform: Thinking Backwards is the Way to Go” summarizes this business driven approach well. Now, in order to make the most of that data and not limit a source to the one and only use case, your collection pipeline should only be considering it as that: a source. This means that it is not the role of your collection pipeline to determine which data will be useful and remove all other data: delta calculation, replacing referentials, etc. is not up to the collection, but to the use case pipelines. Making the most of a datalake’s scalability in storage and letting your use cases define what is useful to them in their own pipelines, you’ll allow for more opportunities to use the underlying source down the line. One last element to make your datalake useful is to anticipate changing functional parameters. Historical depth for your transformations, functional validation for your sources, ways to trigger custom runs… If modifying these parameters has a business or data management use, they should be included in the first iteration of your pipeline developments. In our projects, they have allowed us to be extremely flexible if a pipeline needs functional change and focus on adding new use cases and sources rather than tweaking the same pipeline over and over. Used through scalability of business impact​ Start small, allow it to grow : identify a single use case to automate and build your foundation architecture to host it. Using the best practices presented above you’ll then be able to build on top of this robust architecture. The target for your datalake’s first use case should be for it to be high impact, low time to value. It must be the proof of value your businesses divisions need to invest more in the platform and should be an inspiration for other use cases. Once that use case is identified, along with the data it needs and a design for its transformation pipelines and exposition, you can start building it following the design principles presented above. The steps below are a summary of how that first use case is built, but are also highly reproducible to build new use cases once your foundation architecture is in place. Ingest a new source Technical validation: what are the rules that define whether this data is usable? Set up data structure validation and organize the source in an understandable manner. If the data source is highly likely to evolve over time, make sure that the collection and technical validation pipeline for this source is evolutive as well to anticipate future changes. Build a new use case Functional validation: for this use case, what are the rules that define whether this data is useful? Once again, it is best to leave functional validation to your use case pipelines, as different use cases will have different requirements for what data they want (useful) and what they can legally use (usable). Same goes for how the data is used: delta calculation, targeting referentials, cleaning, etc… these steps should be part of your use case pipeline. Build transformations with break points inside the trusted data storage zone, up to the exposition layer (refined zone / gold), where it is fully ready to serve use cases. Which of these transformations is likely to change, and can you anticipate these changes by using simple configurable parameters? This data storage architecture makes it easy to add new sources and use cases These first two steps will show your datalake’s versatility. It is able to ingest any type of data, from unstructured to structured, streaming or batch. It is also able to transform it efficiently to feed use cases, due to the scalability of its computing power. Build a new serving layer This final step will vary the most between use cases, as depending on your user endpoint, there might not be a unified way to serve refined data. Here you may need additional resources on top of your foundation architecture: an API management service, a database to efficiently serve structured data, a web service or container to display interfaces… That’s it, your use case is fully functional on your datalake. Using the best practices we’ve presented, the use case is robust, evolutive, scalable, understandable, and useful. Once the foundation architecture is laid out and more use cases and sources are added, an argument can be made for a core data model. This model would be built by a single transformation pipeline that unifies deduplication / delta calculation, data cleaning, GDPR compliance transformations and preparation of highly used KPIs for your use cases. The core transformation should be considered as a use case pipeline: its job is to prepare data, saving on computing resources and providing a single source of truth for other use cases. It is also a great way to ease data exploration for data savvy users in the sandbox, allowing them to be inspired through use case agnostic and clean datasets. To maintain relevance, the core data model should be updated with new data sources as they are added, and new use cases using that new source should feed on the cleaned and prepared datasets. A Core data model centralizes all cleaning and pre-calculations, further simplifying the storage architecture Conclusion​ Starting with the identification of a first high impact use case, you’ve been able to build a robust and evolutive datalake. Following the design principles we’ve reviewed, data and use case pipelines in your datalake are usable and useful. You are now able to show a proof of value for your datalake and grow it into a central data platform for your company. The final U we could dive deeper into is “Used” : your goal is now to maintain, grow and manage the datalake as a unified data platform, centralizing data and solutions for your business. An efficient and relevant datalake project comes with technical design challenges, some of which we’ve talked about here, but also organizational challenges. By finding solutions for technical challenges, your datalake has shown its value and it is now essential to ensure its growth. As you coordinate with business divisions, you’ll be able to draw a roadmap for the datalake and improve processes at an organizational level, using “data mesh”-like functional architectures that allow for the best flexibility in use cases, growing your platform’s relevance and enhancing data capabilities for your business.","keywords":"Data Science EkiLab Ekimetrics Eki.Lab Eki Machine Learning Artificial Intelligence Data Science for business Datalake Data Engineering Lakehouse Data Architecture Data Governance Data Validation Data Mesh Azure AWS GCP"},{"title":"Power BI - Improve your development process by using multiple environments","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"blog/2022/03/16/powerbi_multiple_environments","content":"","keywords":"Data Science EkiLab Ekimetrics Eki.Lab Eki Machine Learning Artificial Intelligence Power BI Environments Data Science for business"},{"title":"In Power BI Desktop, make your data sources dynamic​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Power BI - Improve your development process by using multiple environments","url":"blog/2022/03/16/powerbi_multiple_environments#in-power-bi-desktop-make-your-data-sources-dynamic","content":""},{"title":"Step 0 - (Baseline) Have a Power BI report connected to hard-coded data sources​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Power BI - Improve your development process by using multiple environments","url":"blog/2022/03/16/powerbi_multiple_environments#step-0---baseline-have-a-power-bi-report-connected-to-hard-coded-data-sources","content":"As explained in the disclaimer, you should already have a report connected to data sources.

One of the main challenge posed by such concept is how to maintain knowledge from past data into the model, avoiding catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, researchers propose an approach by leveraging prompt engineering. Using prompt Is very common in NLP as it tends to better fine-tune pretrained algorithms.

That feeling of getting to read something fresh off the press. That powdery smell of paper. That daily reading routine to get you awake every morning. All this, however, seems to bring a sense of nostalgia to most people now. The newspaper sector is facing a tough time. The rapid and inevitable shift to digital content across domains has significantly reduced the audience size of the traditional press. At the same time, production costs have become more and more expensive. Covid-19 and lockdowns are changing customer behaviour. Altogether, these factors are rendering the industry’s current distribution strategies obsolete. More than ever, the industry needs to adapt itself to stay in the game. Many publishers are using data and data science techniques such as demand forecasting, sales prediction, supply optimization, and management dashboard to assist their business decisions. In this article, we will shed a light on one of those tools: sales prediction. Mobilis in Mobile (Jules Verne)​ When a publisher sells a magazine issue, they need to estimate the total sales for accounting, financial and management purposes. For example, in accounting, the total sales are needed to calculate the estimated revenue and profit, which may later inform decision-makers to adjust the production and distribution of the next issues. Traditionally, the predictions are based on the domain expertise of the people in charge. However, with data becoming more and more available, we can leverage recent advances in machine learning to improve our predictions. Fig. 1 shows the cumulative sales of a magazine (the data have been anonymized for confidential purposes). The objective is to use the observed data, including the sales curves of all historical issues and the beginning part of the current issue’s curve, to predict the final sales. Fig. 1: Example of magazine sales curves As we can see from the figure, there is a high variability in the sales curves. Averaging the sales of historical issues does not provide a good prediction of the current issue. Naively applying a curve fitting model does not seem like a feasible option either. Furthermore, we do not have that much data to train a data-hungry model such as deep neural network. Context and domain expertise are crucial!​ In the real world, the sales of a magazine issue depends on several factors, such as the content and the cover of the issue (e.g. the better the content and the covers are, the more sales), the season (e.g. some magazine may sell better in summer), the holidays during the sale period (e.g. people may buy a magazine at the train station when they go on vacations). A good prediction model needs to consider those factors to be able to make precise forecasts. There are two big questions: which factors to take into account and how to encode them? To answer the first question, we need the insights of domain experts. They have been working in the industry for many years. More than anyone else, they understand their magazines, the market and customer behaviour. That knowledge is invaluable! For the second question, there is a mathematical framework that allows us to incorporate the prior knowledge (provided by the domain experts and extracted from the data of historical issues) and the observations (the daily reported sales of the current issue) to make a better prediction: Bayesian inference. Bayesian inference as a mathematical tool to combine the prior expectation and the new observed evidence​ Fig. 2: Bayesian inference With the insights provided by domain experts and extracted from the historical data, we can estimate an expectation of the sales of the current issue, prior to its sale period. However, even though the experts have a deep understanding of the product as well as the market, and the historical data may show some characteristics of the sales curves, there is always a grey zone of uncertainty and error. The market evolves; customers change their buying habits; some internal factors were poorly estimated; some external factors were not considered; some unexpected events happen during the sale period, etc. All those factors make the prediction which is purely based on historical experiences less reliable. After the sale of the current issue has taken place, we can cumulate the recorded sales to get the beginning part of its sales curve. The more time passes, the more observations are built up. Those observations provide the latest information of the reality and indicate how the real sales actually evolve. However, the observations themselves contain noise. For example, a point of sale may forget to record a sale or record it a few days late, preventing us from using purely the observations to make a precise prediction. Since we do not have enough subjective data, we can leverage Bayesian inference to fold in the prior knowledge that we have already had (thanks to the inputs of the experts and the historical sales) to draw stronger and sharper predictions. Mathematically, we model the sales by a random variable X that follows a distribution p(X|θ) parameterised by a set of parameters θ: X ~ p(X|θ). The prediction problem is reduced to finding the “correct” θ. Given the observations Xobs (the sales records at the beginning of the sale period of the current issue in our case), frequentist approaches such as the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method find an optimal θ that best fits Xobs: θMLE = argmaxθ(p(Xobs|θ)), then plug it in to make the sales prediction: XpredMLE = argmaxX(p(X|θMLE)). However, Xobs usually contain noise, results in a bad estimation of θ. With Bayesian inference, we can integrate our prior knowledge to get better predictions. Specifically, from the sales of historical issues and the inputs of the experts, we have an idea of how θ should be, modelled as the prior distribution p(θ). Incorporating it with the information provided by the observations Xobs, we get the posterior distribution p(θ|Xobs), which is proportional to the prior p(θ) and the likelihood p(Xobs|θ) (see Fig. 2): p(θ|Xobs) ∝ p(Xobs|θ)*p(θ) In Bayesian inference, rather than predicting a single value of the sales, we predict its distribution, called the posterior predictive distribution: p(XpredBayesian|Xobs) = ∫p(XpredBayesian|θ)*p(θ|Xobs)dθ By doing so, we take into account the uncertainty in the prior, as well as the fact that the observations are noisy. A pipeline—implemented in Spark and PyMC3—of the whole process, is depicted in Fig. 3. At the beginning, based on an analysis of the the characteristics of the issues and the market, the historical sales and the inputs of the experts, we estimate the prior p(θ). During the sale period, this estimation will be regularly revised, updated and adjusted in light of the observations Xobs to get the posterior p(θ|Xobs), which is used to calculate the posterior predictive p(XθpredBayesian|Xobs). The posterior predictive is then formatted and sent to the decision-makers. Fig. 3: Bayesian sales prediction pipeline Results​ Fig. 4 shows an example of the prediction at day 30 of the sale period. We compare the performance of the Bayesian model with that of a frequentist baseline (in this example, is a logarithmic curve fitting model). Both the models are fed with the sales curves of historical issues and the sales records of the first 30 days of the current issue’s sale. Additionally, the Bayesian model has the characteristics of the issues (cover, number of holidays during the sale period, etc.) as well as the opinions of the experts on the similarity between the current issue and some issues in the past. The objective is to predict the sales of the rest 30 days. We can observe that the prediction of the frequentist model is too optimistic because of the (false) positive signals during the first half of the sale period. By contrast, the 95% HDI (highest density interval) of the Bayesian prediction well covers the true sales. This is thanks to the prior insights that the Bayesian model has been given. Fig. 4: Example of the sales predictions of a magazine at day 30 Conclusion​ We have walked through an example of how to make better predictions of magazine sales.

However, pandas has inner limitations when working with large datasets. Alternatives for distributed computing exist but each of them requires us to skill up. The main barrier is the syntax required by the language which is often complex. Different packages tried to simplify the process (koalas for instance) but we want to focus ourselves on Fugue. Fugue is described as a “unified interface for distributed computing that lets users execute Python, pandas, and SQL code on Spark and Dask without rewrites”. Fugue does not require a lot of time to get used to it and is a good common tool for SQL users and python ones.

Haystack is a comprehensive framework enabling its users to use state-of-the-art Question Answering model to browse large textual datasets. Haystack is a local and little search engine. It is meant to be used by a broad range of users (from beginners to expert).

GitHub - deepset-ai/haystack Liquid Neural Network: Next generation model for sequential data​ Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) demonstrated a strong performance when used for sequential data. RNN are made of complex recurrent units enabling the network to keep track of past information while new inputs are fed in. In 2018, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations appeared and were seen as a major change in how we are modelling data. Instead of modeling the true generative function of Y, we are looking to model its derivative. This article was seen as a major change in how we can shift from a discrete model state to a continuous one. Liquid Time Constant Networks (LTC) were introduced in 2020 with a strong emphasis on the concept of hidden state in the model. In previous models, hidden state at time t is optimized according to the output at time t (maximizing the accuracy). In LTCs, hidden state is used both to predict the output, but also the next hidden state t+1. It means that at each time-step, you update your memory, according to what you saw, see and expect to see in the future. This application is particularly powerful when you need to generate data at a given horizon. If you want a quick deep dive in LTC you can follow the first link. The second one is the original paper that might be hard to read the in first instance.

This blog post presents three contenders to be THE tool to use. The author compares three technologies widely used: MongoDB, ElasticSearch and Amazon Redshift. This comparison will look at how they index, shard and aggregate data. While MongoDB has the biggest popularity and ElasticSearch gains some hype, Amazon Redshift is a tool to be considered. Storage for Data Engineering: Which is the Best? | Toptal App and Web Development​ Using properly Map in Javascript​ A “map” object is a new addition coming into Javascript since ES6. While the “object” is widely used for recording values, they should be avoided when you have a variable number entries (that can evolve along time). In this case, using a “map” object is appropriate and results in a significant memory saving and computational performance improvement. When You Should Prefer Map Over Object In JavaScript (zhenghao.io) Special Section: Yolo’s creator history​ Jon Redmon, the poney lovers and Computer Vision boss !​ For anyone who worked on Computer Vision during studies or even in professional environments, Object Detection always raises as a major challenge. The task consists in detecting in a picture multiple instances and drawing a bounding box around it. Back in 2015, the state-of-the-art architecture is a Region-based Convolutional Neural Network or RCNN (followed by different improvement called Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN…). To make it brief and simple, RCNN takes Regions Of Interest (ROIs), which are little rectangle cropped from the image, fed to a Neural Network. Eventually ROIs are pooled together to produce the true bounding boxes we want. The biggest limit of R-CNN is the ROIs generation part which can take a lot of time before getting a prediction (therefore improvements of R-CNN always have a speed related word). Jon Redmon, who at the time was in the early years of his PhD, proposed a new architecture called YOLO (You Only Look Once). The framework approaches the task of object detection as a regression problem rather than a classification one (R-CNN uses a classifier to predict bounding boxes). He also modifies the framework to get a single network that can be trained and optimized. This change of loss enables the network to be fully trainable on the whole image. The model shows exceptional performance both for real-time detection, but also in terms of accuracy. Following this breakthrough, Jon Redmon worked on several new versions of YOLO, all becoming state-of-the-art in the field. However, in early 2020, he decided to stop his research in the field of Computer Vision as he saw a rise of ethical concerns around his work (especially in the military field). I strongly invite you to read (at least) his resume which is by far the best one in the AI field! Check out his website to deepen your knowledge about his research.

The reason behind this is that time series, data measured over time, are omnipresent in our day-to-day life and are used in a wide range of industries. For instance, in the retail industry, forecasting is a crucial task to optimize processes and increase efficiency. Many examples can be found in the literature mainly focusing on demand forecasting [1] and sales forecasting [2]. In the past, retail companies have relied on traditional time series forecasting approaches based on statistics. More recently, companies and researchers have grown interest in machine learning and deep learning techniques and algorithms to predict the demand more accurately among other requirements. To evolve as a leader in data science, at Ekimetrics, we keep an eye on the state-of-the-art of time series forecasting and investigate new techniques to eventually, adopt them and improve our solutions in the long run. This article will focus on our journey with neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) applied to time series forecasting and specifically focused on a client’s use case. Selling magazines​ Before entering into the subject, if you have not read our article on how we use Bayesian inference to increase our predictions of magazines sales have a look at it here. It is an interesting application of a Bayesian framework to enhance sales prediction for a publisher. Our exploration of neural ODEs focuses on the same use case. In the world of newspapers and magazines, it is crucial to be able to estimate the final volume of sales for accounting and management purposes. Indeed, publishers adjust their production and distribution of issues based on these forecasts. Conventionally, the projections rely strongly on the domain expertise of the people in charge. But nowadays, with all recent advances in the field of data science and improvements with regards to data availability, publishers can leverage modern forecasting techniques to enhance their predictions. The figure below, Fig. 1, represents the cumulative sales of a magazine composed by a set of 14 different issues. Note that the data have been anonymized for confidentiality purposes. Our task is to use the observed data, including the sales curves of all historical issues and the beginning part of the current issue’s curve, to predict the final sales of the current issue. Fig. 1: Example of magazine sales curves Introduction to neural ODEs​ In this section we provide an overview of what neural ODEs are, and what makes them so special. For the curious readers, complementary resources and blog posts that present this topic in detail, are provided at the end of this article. To understand neural ODEs, we need to introduce some basic concepts on neural networks (NNs). In essence, NNs are a succession of input, hidden and output layers originally inspired by the human brain. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is one the most popular feedforward neural network due to its simplicity. By means of activation functions and linear combinations of the input data, these networks introduce non linearities and become universal approximators [3]. The equation h(t+1) = f(ht, θt), captures the evolution of the hidden layers of a MLP network with ht referring to the previous layer and θt to a parameter of the network. Without entering too much into the details, these networks are usually trained by minimizing a loss function and backpropagation, propagating the computed error, and updating the weights accordingly. What we must keep in mind here is that these networks have a limited number of layers and thus, of evaluation points. Could we achieve an infinite number of evaluation points for time continuous applications? The instinctive answer is no since we cannot have an infinite number of layers. However, we are going to review some interesting properties of residual networks (ResNet) that will help us answer this question. Fig. 2: ResNet schema [4] A ResNet is a neural network that has an architecture based on the pattern pictured in Fig. 2 which entails that the network follows the equation ht+1 = ht + f(ht, θt). This equation might be familiar to some readers with a background in mathematics since it resembles Euler’s method. In short, this method is useful to solve initial value problems, a problem modelled by an ordinary differential equation with an initial condition. Interestingly, a residual network adds hidden states between the input and the output and discretizes the continuous relationship between them, which is similar to Euler's method. In [5] the authors take a different approach by considering the continuous limit of each discrete layer of the network. Thus, instead of having a discrete number of layers, the progression of the hidden states is continuous, obtaining the following equation where h(t) is the value of the hidden state evaluated for some t. dℎ(𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 = 𝑓(ℎ(𝑡), 𝜃t, 𝑡) Then, in a neural ODE the hidden state dynamic can be parametrized by the equation above where 𝑓(ℎ(𝑡), 𝜃t, 𝑡) is a neural network parametrized by 𝜃t at layer t. Therefore, it is possible to solve this ODE by solving its integral. h(t) = ∫ f(h(t), 𝜃t, t) By means of a numerical ODE method, it is possible to evaluate the network at any desired depth. And thus, it is possible to approximate functions over these hidden state dynamics by using ODE solvers such as: ŷ = h(t1) = ODESolve(h(t0), t0, t1, 𝜃t, f) Now, if we go back to our initial question regarding the possibility of having an infinite or quasi-infinite number of evaluation points, we can state that neural ODEs enable us to achieve that Fig. 3 illustrates this idea by comparing the vector field created by a traditional residual network and an ODE network. In essence, an ODE network defines a continuous vector field since this network can be evaluated at any depth. Whereas, on the other hand, the residual network is limited to a discrete number of layers. Fig. 3: Comparison between a ResNet and an ODE network vector fields transformations [5] Before moving on to the applications of neural ODEs, it is important to note the endeavor of performing backpropagation. Essentially, the more evaluation points you have in your network, the higher the number of intermediate forward passes to store. To overcome this, the authors of the original paper [5] which received the 2018 NeurIPS best paper award, introduced a mathematical trick known as the Adjoint method. We will not get into the details here, but you can dig deeper into this concept by checking the resources we have left at the end of this article. Applications of neural ODEs​ The main advantage of neural ODEs is the possibility of working with continuous-time series models. In addition, they are generally more memory efficient than other networks such as the MLP and can gain from adaptive computation since modern ODE solvers allow to monitor the level of error and adapt the evaluation strategy. For example, we can reduce accuracy for low power applications. All these benefits make neural ODEs a great tool for applications dealing with continuous time systems, irregularly sampled data, and scalable and invertible normalizing flows. Besides, neural ODEs are very interesting for time series forecasting too. Basically, they can be used to fit time series and then extrapolate them. Since 2018, we have seen an increasing number of scientific papers presenting neural ODEs to deal with forecasting challenges in the energy [6] and the healthcare [7] sectors. Coming back to our specific use case, although Fig. 1 introduced at the beginning of this article shows that applying a curve fitting model does not seem like a feasible option, we considered our sales curves as trajectories to employ neural ODE models to fit the curves and forecast the final volumes of sales. We can formulate our problem with the following equation. xθt+1 = xθ0 + ∫ b(xθu, u) du Where x is an issue belonging to a magazine and b in our case is a neural network, something resembling to b(xθu, u) = MLP(xθu), with its corresponding parameters. Results​ Initially, we have used a standard neural ODE network to deal with our time series forecasting use case. The figure below, Fig. 4, is an animation representing the fitting of a curve of sales of a specific issue. Bear in mind that the data have been anonymized for privacy purposes. In this figure, we can observe that the model is able to fit the curve successfully after some iterations. The idea then is to fit the sales curves from all historical issues and the beginning part of the current issue’s curve to predict the final sales by extrapolation. Although we have obtained promising results, they are not good enough. The main reason being that neural ODEs are well suited for deterministic systems and in our case, we deal with a non-deterministic one. Fig. 4: Curve fitting of the sales curve of an issue Inspired by the ideas presented in [8], instead of a standard neural ODE network like the one introduced before, we have been recently working with stochastic differential neural networks (SDEs). SDEs are a type of continous neural network enabling to introduce a stochastic component and consequently, work with non-deterministic systems and consider external factors. We have obtained promising preliminary results with this procedure, but they require further analysis. Conclusion​ In this article, we have introduced you into the world of neural ordinary differential equations applied to time series forecasting. We have gone through a short theoretical explanation and presented you our exploration with neural ODEs to strengthen predictions for a magazine publisher. At Ekimetrics, we accompany a large portfolio of clients across a wide range of industries to help them steer their data opportunity, build capabilities, and deploy actionable DS solutions to power up a sustainable growth. As a leader in the field of data science, we perform recurring technological watches and stay tuned on the state-of-the-art of the fields of machine learning and deep learning. As stated during this article, we are particularly interested in time series and investigate recent advances on the subject to eventually, embrace them and expand our solutions. References​ [1] J.

Then, the multi-knapsack problem itself is introduced. Then we apply the rules defined before on how to solve optimization problems and obtain the optimal solution to the multi-knapsack problem, formulated as a Mixed Integer problem and using Python-MIP package. Let's now introduce simple steps one can follow to approach optimization problems with optimization solvers. Main steps while creating an optimization model to solve a business problem​ Once a business problem that could benefit from optimization has been identified, we can define a systematic approach based on 3 steps for solving all kind of optimization problems with optimization solvers. These 3 steps are highlighted in the figure below. Figure 1 : The 3 main steps for solving a business problem through optimization In more details, these 3 steps are: Create the conceptual mathematical model that defines the different variables, constraints, etc. in the business problem. This step consists in writing down on paper the equations that define our problem. Translate the conceptual mathematical model into a computer program. For most programming languages used for optimization, the computer program will largely resembles the mathematical equations one would write on paper. Solve the mathematical model using a math programming solver. The solver available for Mathematical Programming (solvers such as GLPK, Gurobi, CPLEX...) relies on very sophisticated algorithms. Important algorithms and ideas used in these solvers are, among many others: simplex method, branch &amp; bound, use of heuristics... Let's see those 3 steps for the case of the multi-knapsack problem. The multi-knapsack problem​ The objective here is, given a set of n items and a set of m knapsacks, to maximize the total value of the items put in the knapsacks without exceeding their capacity. Below, wi represents the weight of item i, pi the value of item i while cj represents the capacity of knapsack j. Figure 2: Description of the multi-knapsack problem The multi-knapsack is an extension of the classical knapsack problem where instead of considering only one knapsack, we consider as many as we want. This allows to easily extend the complexity of this problem. While the problem is relatively easy to define mathematically, it belongs to the class of NP-hard problems. Without going into the details of what defines NP-hard problems, we can easily see that the complexity of the knapsack problems explodes when the number of knapsacks and items increases. Indeed, we have mn available combinations we would need to test should we want to apply a brute-force approach for solving this problem. Just with 10 knapsacks and 80 items, there are 1080 combinations, which is the estimation of the number of atoms in the universe! And 10 knapsacks and 80 items is still quite limited... Let's now try to create the conceptual mathematical model by defining the problem with equations. Creating the conceptual mathematical model​ A quick translation of the multi-knapsack problem with equation can be written as the following: Now that we managed to translate the problem into a set of equations, let's translate this mathematical model so that it is understood by a computer program. Below, we will make use of the Python package Python-MIP which is open-source and provides tools for modeling and solving Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Problems (MIP), relying on fast open source solvers. Translating the mathematical model into a computer program with Python-MIP​ Before solving the problem, we have to generate an instance for it (have data defining the problem). To do so, you can use the following code that will generate an instance of this problem with 40 items to store in 5 bags. import pandas as pd import numpy as np import pickle def data_generator_knapsack(number_bags, number_items, minimum_weight_item, maximum_weight_item, minimum_value_item, maximum_value_item, max_weight_bag): data = {} weights = np.random.randint(minimum_weight_item, maximum_weight_item, size = number_items) values = np.random.randint(minimum_value_item, maximum_value_item, size = number_items) data['weights'] = weights data['values'] = values data['items'] = list(range(len(weights))) data['num_items'] = len(weights) data['bins'] = list(range(number_bags)) data['bin_capacities'] = np.random.randint(0, max_weight_bag, size = number_bags) + np.int(np.mean(data['weights'])) return(data) number_bags = 5 number_items = 40 minimum_weight_item = 0 maximum_weight_item = 75 minimum_value_item = 0 maximum_value_item = 75 max_weight_bag = 150 data = data_generator_knapsack(number_bags, number_items, minimum_weight_item, maximum_weight_item, minimum_value_item, maximum_value_item, max_weight_bag) Let's now import the package used to have access to the MIP solver, here using the python package Python-MIP: from mip import Model, xsum, maximize, BINARY Now, we can translate the mathematical model so that it is understood by Python-MIP. def mip_solve_knapsack(data): model = Model(&quot;knapsack&quot;) x = [[model.add_var(var_type=BINARY) for i in data['items']] for j in data['bins']] model.objective = maximize(xsum((xsum(data['values'][i] * x[j][i] for i in data['items']) for j in data['bins']))) for j in data['bins']: model += xsum(data['weights'][i] * x[j][i] for i in data['items']) &lt;= data['bin_capacities'][j] # Each item can be in at most one bin for i in data['items']: model += xsum(x[j][i] for j in data['bins']) &lt;= 1 model.optimize() return(model) Remark how close it is from the original equations! These solvers are very powerful and yet easy to use directly in Python. The code is indeed very close to the original equations. Solving the mathematical model with Python-MIP​ Using the mip_solve_knapsack function defined in the previous section, we can access to important information regarding the problem, such as the final objective value and the values of xij telling us what were the best combinations of items inside knapsacks. Some Mathematical Optimization packages​ In the notebook associated to this article, the package Python-MIP was used. Python-MIP is free, but many other packages exist for solving optimization problems on Python (and other languages of course like Julia). For instance OR-Tools from Google is a well-recognized free solver, with detailed documentation. On the other side, Gurobi is a very popular commercial solution for mathematical optimization and its documentation is extremely rich, with quick introductions about Mathematical Programming, Linear Programming and Mixed-Integer Programming. Importantly, it has a large number of modeling examples from all industry fields directly available on Google Colab allowing to better grasp notions of Mathematical Modelling and to improve modeling skills to tackle all kind of optimization problems with Python. This resource can be of use even if one doesn't plan to use this commercial software but rather a free package such as OR-Tools. Conclusion​ In this article was introduced the multi-knapsack problem, an NP-complete problem, very difficult to solve when taking many items and bags. The approach to solve the multi-knapsack problem relied on Python-MIP, a free optimization package using powerful MILP solvers to solve very efficiently all kinds of optimization problems. In the next part of this series on the multi-knapsack problem, well studied in the field of Operations Research and at the heart of many real optimization problems, we'll highlight how Deep Reinforcement Learning can be used in order to solve combinatorial optimization problems such as this one.

The main objective of this article is to introduce Reinforcement Learning as a way to solve combinatorial optimization problems (Reinforcement Learning can actually be used to solve a much wider range of optimization problems). First, the classical Reinforcement Learning framework will be briefly presented. Then, we'll see how to frame the multi-knapsack problem for Reinforcement Learning, followed by explanations on why we chose to explore RL for this combinatorial optimization problem. Eventually, the Q-learning (no neural networks) and Policy Gradient (with neural networks) approaches will be introduced and their performance will be evaluated on the knapsack problem. Reinforcement Learning for the Knapsack problem​ What is Reinforcement Learning?​ The image below represents the Reinforcement Learning framework. It describes in a simple, yet accurate manner, one of the main ideas behind Reinforcement Learning. Figure 1 : The Reinforcement Learning framework Basically, an agent receives information about the state of an environment he evolves in, information we will call St as it describes the state at timestep t. Based on this information it receives, the RL agent will choose an action among all the actions it has the right to take at each timestep. We will call such action At, the action at time t, with At belonging to AAt(st) the set of available actions given the state St. When an action is taken, it has an impact on the environment and the agent will receive information about the new state of the environment St+1 but also a reward to incentivize it to take actions which will maximize the total rewards it expects to obtain at the end of an episode. To apply reinforcement learning to solve business problems, these problems have to be framed as a Markov Decision Process, as seen above. More details can be found on how to rigorously define the Reinforcement Learning in the excellent course given by David Silver (principal research scientist at DeepMind, now owned by Google). You may find his lectures using the previous link, with lectures 1 and 2 being the most pertinent. Now, to get a better grasp on how to frame a problem for Reinforcement Learning, let’s consider two practical examples. As a first example, we can consider for instance an AI trader. It could have as available actions the possibility to buy or sell many different products. Its actions have an impact on the environment. First, the money it has and the products it owns will be modified, but also if it buys a massive amount of a certain product, it may have an important impact on the future prices. The final goal for it may be to earn as much money as possible. The description of this first example with the prism of Reinforcement Learning is given in figure 2. Figure 2 - Example of an AI trader described through the prism of Reinforcement Learning For the case of a self driving car as the AI agent, the actions it can take could be turning, stopping, accelerating. The information it will receive at each timestep are the speed of the car, its geolocation and probably many others. The environment can be the real world around the car, or just a simulator. The final reward will take into account how fast the car has reached a certain goal position, without damaging things or killing people for instance. Should it damage objects, it could for instance receive negative rewards. This information is summarized in the figure 3 below. Figure 3 - Example of a self driving car described through the prism of Reinforcement Learning Let’s now tackle the case of the multi-knapsack problem! How to adapt the multi-Knapsack problem for solving with Reinforcement Learning​ The precise definition of the multi-knapsack problem was given in the first part of this serie of articles on the knapsack problem. The figure below describes visually the problem at stake. Figure 4 - Description of the multi-knapsack problem In our case, one could think about the agent as a person trying to carefully choose among the many clothes he/she possesses before going on a long trip. The environment would be the empty bags and all the clothes to choose from. At each timestep, the person would have the choice to take one element among the available clothes to put it inside one of the bags, the bags needing to be closed (and thus not to full) before leaving for the trip. The objective is to maximize the value of the clothes chosen for the trip. And that’s it! Our problem is framed for Reinforcement Learning. Why we chose to explore RL for combinatorial optimization problems​ The last two decades have known the breakthrough of Deep Learning which is now massively entering all fields of industry whether this is for Computer Vision, disease predictions, product recommendation, Natural Language Processing applications, etc. Massive investments follow in the field of Machine Learning implying a virtuous circle with more results and regular new breakthroughs. Due to these developments, Deep Reinforcement Learning has emerged from the field of Reinforcement Learning which has been studied for a long time and whose goal is to take actions in an environment in order to maximize a defined cumulative reward. This allowed new recent breakthroughs, such as the AI AlphaGo beating professional Go players in 2016 and more recently AlphaStar beating world champions of the video game Starcraft (more on that in DeepMind blog article or in the Nature paper). Figure 5 - Visualization highlighting the trained AlphaStar performing against a top Starcraft human players We’ll say a few words about this video game environment, because this achievement is one of the reasons which motivates the use of Reinforcement Learning for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Indeed, with the knapsack problem, we have a discrete action space with a limited number of actions, although the range of available actions can become extremely high by changing the number of available items and knapsacks. Having an AI agent beating the world’s best players on this game is an important breakthrough as this video game environment is extremely complex, with only imperfect information being provided to the agent, the action space being enormous with a choice between up to 1026 different actions, and actions being taken almost in real time, every 0.2 seconds. Eventually, planning is made on long term and the agent doesn’t know until the end of the game whether it has won the game or not. While applying Deep Reinforcement Learning to video games allows to test the performance of the algorithms very accurately, allowing to judge how it performs in very different environments, applications also begin to appear in other fields, opening the perspective of using these techniques in different industry fields in the next few years. Deep Reinforcement Learning is definitely a field with high potential, and proofs have been shown that it can solve very well high-dimensional problems. Especially, many articles were published where these algorithms were applied to finance problems. Now that we have seen the potential of Reinforcement Learning for solving a problem such as the knapsack problem, it is important to keep in mind some important characteristics of Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches: Reinforcement Learning algorithms provides us with approximations of the optimal solutions on the contrary to the solutions that could provide Mixed Integer Programming solvers as the ones introduced in the first part of this series of articles on the knapsack problem;For the same reason, Reinforcement Learning algorithms will always provide us solutions to the problem, on the contrary to exact methods which could be unable to provide any solution for very complex problems. For that reason, Reinforcement Learning approaches are for instance being developed in order to solve partial differential equations of very high dimensionality, where usual solvers are unable to provide a solution;Reinforcement Learning algorithms perform online optimization, meaning that once they have been trained, they are able to solve very complex problems immediately. They have thus tremendous potential for applications which require to solve problems very frequently in a limited time window, such as in trading or product recommendation for instance. As seen in the beginning of this section, Reinforcement Learning algorithms have a very high potential for a wide range of business problems. Let's now introduce one of the two Reinforcement Learning approaches used in this notebook. The first one, the Q-learning approach, isn't based on neural networks and doesn't scale well when the dimensionality of the problem increases. We have studied it as it is at the core of other important algorithms such as Deep Q Learning, much more powerful. We will thus concentrate on another promising approach, based on neural networks: the Policy Gradient approach. Using Q-Learning and Policy Gradient algorithms on the Knapsack problem​ A simple introduction to Policy Gradient​ The basic principle with a policy gradient approach is that, for each state s received as input, our algorithm will provide us a probability distribution for the actions to take, allowing us to know which object our algorithm recommands us to put first in the knapsack. In the formula below, 𝜋 gives us this probability. More precisely, 𝜋 gives us the probability to take action a knowing that we currently at state s and given the 𝜃 values of the model parameters, neurons in our case as we use neural networks. The use of neural networks isn't mandatory here, but very frequent to obtain good results on complex problems. An example of a representation of a simple neural network is given recalled below. Figure 6 - Representation of a simple neural network Our model architecture can be visualized with this representation. If we dig a bit deeper into the details of our model's architecture, we have: As input of the neural network, a description of the current state of the system, that is the value and price information for all items, information about the already selected items and about the current and maximum weight limit inside the different bags; Thanks to this information, our model associates to each possible action a probability and we can then select the action that the algorithm recommends us to take first, that is which object should be stored in which knapsack at the current timestep. This is the output of our model; The parameters of this model, the neurons, are updated at the end of each episode, an episode beginning when all the objects are available and ending when the bags are sufficiently full (or all objects have been selected...). The update of the parameters (𝜃) of the model taking place at the end of each episode only and not each time an action is proposed by the model, the approach is called a Monte Carlo approach; The updates of the parameters are made in order to maximize the value of the items stored inside the knapsacks and this approach is based on techniques such as stochastic gradient descent. Now that the Policy Gradient has been described, let's see how our algorithms performed on the knapsack problem! Evaluating the performance of the RL algorithms​ As summarized in figure 7 below, in order to evaluate the performance of the different algorithms, we chose to apply our two RL algorithms (Q-Learning and Policy Gradient) to 3 different environments of increasing difficulty. We trained each algorithm over 400 episodes. At the beginning of a new experience, the algorithm had all its coefficients reinitialized. We perform several experiences in order to evaluate how robust is the algorithm. Figure 7 - Description of the evaluation process for the different algorithms Eventually, we evaluated the performance of the algorithms with 3 metrics: The mean reward shows how good on average the algorithm is;The standard deviation highlights the potential lack of robustness of the algorithm;The performance ratio RL vs MILP tells us how close is the RL algorithm to the optimal solution provided by a MILP solver (details on how to obtain such a solution are given in the notebook). Results with Q-Learning (no neural networks)​ The graphs on the left show that overall our Q-Learning algorithm does indeed improve through training as its reward improved over time. However, we can see that the performance ratio RL vs MILP is very low, meaning that it is far from achieving as good results as what we could get using state-of-the-art MILP solvers. Figure 8 - Performance of the Q-Learning algorithm Furthermore, environments of increasing complexity / dimensionality will be much more difficult to handle for Q-Learning, as its Q-value matrix has as number of columns the number of items multiplied by the number of knapsacks and as rows all the possible states which could exist. Increasing only slightly the number of knapsacks or bags will thus quickly make the Q-Learning algorithm unusable. Results with Policy Gradient (based on neural networks)​ The results of the learning process with Policy Gradient are much better than with Q-learning. At the beginning, due to random initialization of the neural network parameters, the actions are taken at random and the reward is very low, but it quickly improves until reaching a local maximum, not global as it is still lower than the solution obtained with the MILP solver. The performance ratio is quite good on the three different environments, reaching approximately 80% for each. The algorithm scales well when the complexity increases. We see however that the standard deviation is quite high, which highlights the fact that each time a model is initialized, it can converge to quite different values. It is thus not extremely robust and several initializations are required before finding good results approaching the optimal solution. Figure 9 - Performance of the REINFORCE (policy-gradient approach) algorithm On the graph below are highlighted some of the limitations we have witnessed with Policy Gradient algorithms such as the REINFORCE algorithm. We have a lack of robustness, having our algorithm sometimes working very well, sometimes leading to a poorer reward. Figure 10 - REINFORCE algorithm (gradient-policy approach) appears as lacking robustness For that reason, the hyperparameter tuning is made more complicated. Indeed comparing one combination of hyperparameters with another one isn't enough to be certain about which combination of hyperparameters is the best, because of the high variability of results for fixed hyperparameters. Opening​ For obtaining the results given in this article, we reproduced classical Reinforcement Learning algorithms: the Q-learning algorithm which does not rely on the use of neural networks, and a Policy Gradient algorithm which relies on neural networks. We saw that the latter obtained much better results than the former as we could expect. We also built our own multi-knapsack environment file, allowing us to easily modify greatly the complexity of the environment by increasing both the number of available items to put in the knapsacks and the number of knapsacks. While creating the environment file, we followed the nomenclature proposed by Open AI Gym for building Reinforcement Learning environments, using the same method names used to define an Open AI Gym environment. The objective was to be able to experiment much more quickly in the future by making use of one of the different Deep Reinforcement Learning libraries (Stable Baselines, TF Agents, Tensorforce…). Indeed, these libraries allow access to many different advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms already implemented, which can directly be used on new problems if the environment file describing the problem has been built using Open AI Gym nomenclature. Another article will be written soon to tell more about how to perform hyperparameter tuning for RL using the hyperparameter optimization framework Optuna and how to compare and evaluate the efficiency of many different RL algorithms using Stable Baselines!","keywords":"Data Science EkiLab Ekimetrics Eki.Lab Eki Machine Learning Artificial Intelligence Data Science for business Operational Research Optimization Knapsack problem Deep Reinforcement Learning"},{"title":"Deploying your Data Science app to the Cloud","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"blog/2022/04/21/docker","content":"TL;DR​ Using optimized containers images in your favourite CI/CD pipeline will help you deploy your Data Science app quickly &amp; easily. Check out the replay of our workshop at Datacraft and our Mastercraft video about container best practices. Data Science storytelling with Streamlit​ Over the past year, Streamlit has become one of our favourite tools to share data insights through a web app. It's a low-code, data science oriented Python framework that makes your scripts shine in a web app. You can use it to quickly build beautiful visualizations but as data is even better when shared, we would like to help you make it easily accessible to your teammates and colleagues. We will deploy one of the apps in the Streamlit Gallery : NYC Uber Ridesharing Data. Running the app​ Let's keep it simple and follow these steps to get the code and use venv to create a virtual environment with the following steps: &gt; git clone git@github.com:streamlit/demo-uber-nyc-pickups.git &gt; cd demo-uber-nyc-pickups &gt; py -3.8 -m venv .venv &gt; .venv/scripts/activate &gt; pip install -r requirements.txt info We are showcasing venv here as it is included in Python itself. We invite you to explore other tools such as Poetry, pipenv or conda depending on your needs and preferences and to always make use of them, especially when collaborating on multiple projects as it will save you from conflicts in your installations. Now, you should be able to run it locally: streamlit run index.py Docker, the cloudy whale​ Docker is one of the most popular containerization tools and is widely used in the context of cloud-based solutions. In this article, we will review how to set up your environment so that you can leverage this tool and level up your development workflow! The advantage we will explore in this article is the ability to package your environment with all its dependencies and be 99.99% sure that it will be able to run on your target environment. &quot;If it runs on Docker, it will run everywhere.&quot; - one hopeful DataOps You can safely share your app and be sure that it will run in the same conditions as you worked on and ensure reproducibility of your results. Creating your container​ Write Dockerfile​ The Dockerfile is the recipe of your container. It contains all the instructions to produce &amp; reproduce it identically everywhere it will be run: on another laptop, maybe with a different OS, in the cloud. Some quick definitions: The Docker image is the result of the build of the Dockerfile.The Docker container is the result of running the image.You can pull and push images to a container registry. Choosing the base image​ It always starts with a FROM instruction that defines what is the base image which can be either: a linux-based OS: ubuntu, debian, centos...an OS with preinstalled tools: python-3.8, mongo-5.0.7, node-17.9.0a ready-to-use image of a project like the Docker Tutorial. Choosing your base image is important as it can help you reduce the amount of steps to get ready. If you chose Ubuntu as your base image for a Python project, you will need to write the instructions to install the Python version you want to install and your image will also come with many other packages that are preinstalled in the OS that you may not need for your projet. This is why Python images are available. It comes with Python already installed and some images (like slim images) also remove packages that aren't necessary for Python development. This strongly impacts the size of your image as shown here: These are official Docker images and depending on which version you pull, you can see the size difference is quite noticeable. python 3.8 is almost 1GB.python 3.8-slim reduces it by 86%.python 3.8-alpine even goes down to &lt;50MB. Alpine is not recommended for Python development as standard PyPi wheels don't work on Alpine and you have to compile them for every package, which can lead to additional research to properly achieve it. In some instances, compiling can also be very lengthy, like matplotlib that takes more than 25min to build: Nobody ain't got time for that. Efficient Build Instructions​ So let's build our image using a small, ready-to-python image like python:3.8-slim. We first need to install all our app requirements. So we add our requirements.txt file and install just like we would do locally : FROM python:3.8-slim # We place ourself in a dedicated folder WORKDIR /app # Installing requirements ADD ./requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir Adding the file alone and installing the requirements right after allows you to create a layer that will be cached and you will not have to reuse this step in a future build. It is generally a good practice to use the cache when in development mode as you don't want to spend 10 minutes at every build of your requirements (you know it can take a while). The way Docker cache works is that by default it will reuse the highest unmodified layers. Here are the commands that generate a layer and which you want to be able to cache and/or gather in a single instruction. FROM creates a layer from the base image.COPY adds files from your Docker client’s current directory.RUN builds your application with make.CMD specifies what command to run within the container. Source Then, we add the different required files with the ADD or COPY instructions. In our example, we need the python main code, the data and one image. ADD streamlit_app.py uber-raw-data-sep14.csv.gz uber_demo.png /app/ To access the app, we need to open port 8051 on the container. Otherwise, even if the app is running, it will not be accessible from outside the container by a browser. Instruction is : EXPOSE 8051 The last instruction is the RUN, which tells Docker which command needs to be run at the start of the container. For us, it means starting the Streamlit app with the command streamlit run /index.py, which in Docker syntax is: CMD [&quot;streamlit&quot;, &quot;run&quot; ,&quot;/index.py&quot;] The final Dockerfile should look like this: Dockerfile FROM python:3.8-slim WORKDIR /app EXPOSE 8501 ADD requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt RUN pip install -r requirements.txt ADD streamlit_app.py uber-raw-data-sep14.csv.gz uber_demo.png /app/ CMD [&quot;streamlit&quot;,&quot;run&quot;,&quot;streamlit_app.py&quot;] Run your Streamlit container​ To build your image, just run the command: docker build --tag ekilab-demo-container . Once built, you can run the container with the command: docker run -dp 8501:8501 ekilab-demo-container Your app should now be running and available at http://localhost:8501. Live Reload​ The issue with the current setup is that if you make a change to your app, you will need to rebuild and re-run the container to see the changes in your browser. We don't want to rebuild the whole environment, and to do that we will use the volume feature of Docker, and make it easy with docker-compose. Docker-compose is a powerful tool to orchestrate multiple containers. But in our case, we will only use it to make our life easier. docker-compose.yml version: &quot;3.9&quot; services: ekilab-demo-container: build: . ports: - &quot;8501:8501&quot; volumes: - ./:/app Now, you only need to remember one single command: docker compose up. It will build your image, run it with the correct parameters and link it to the correct volume. Ship it to the Cloud !​ If you don't have an Azure account, you can create one for free and get 200$ of credits for trying out the platform. Log into Azure​ Log into your account using the Azure CLI with the az login command. Then, we will need a container registry. At Ekimetrics, we usually build our infrastructure using an Infrastructure-As-Code tool such as Terraform. But for the sake of simplicity, let's use simple CLI commands to create our resources. Container registry​ The container registry will store the different versions of our container. It can also be used to store other images. You can consider it as your private DockerHub. az acr create --name ekilabhub --resource-group ekimetrics-demo --sku basic --admin-enabled true Linux App Service Plan​ To run our app, we need a Linux-based resource. This is what the App Service Plan offers. B1 is a free instance that you can use for your small apps and Proof Of Concept. az appservice plan create --resource-group ekimetrics-demo -n ekimetrics-lasp -l westeurope --is-linux --sku B1 Now, we have several options : Option 1 - build the image locally and push it to the container registryOption 2 - build the image directly from the registryOption 3 - build and push the image from a CI/CD pipeline Let's try : # log into the container registry docker login ekilabhub.azurecr.io --username ekilabhub --password its4secr€t! # Option 1 - push the new Docker image to the registry docker push ekilabhub.azurecr.io/ekilab/ekilab-demo-container:latest # Option 2 - directly build on Azure Container Registry az acr build --registry ekilabhub --resource-group ekimetrics-demo-rg --image ekilab-demo-container . The Web App​ Finally we can create the web app, based on our previously created App Service Plan, and by retrieving the image from the Container Registry. az webapp create --resource-group ekimetrics-demo-rg -p ekimetrics-lasp -n ekilab-demo-app -i ekilabhub.azurecr.io/ekilab/ekilab-demo-container:latest Let's Automate!​ It's all been fun but we don't want to do this every time we update the code. It would be easy to make a mistake and you may want to collaborate with other Data Scientists on your team and have their updates deployed without your help! Bitbucket Pipelines​ In this example we are using Bitbucket Pipelines to automate these deployment steps but the logic is very similar in other tools such as Azure DevOps, Cloud Build, Gitlab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Jenkins... The common concept behind these tools is to store all the instructions in a YAML file and execute them at every commit to a given branch. In our example, the master branch gathers the code that will be delivered to production. bitbucket-pipelines.yml image: python:3.8 pipelines: branches: master: - step: name: Build and Push the image services: - docker script: # build the image - docker build -t ekilabhub.azurecr.io/ekilab/ekilab-demo-container:$BITBUCKET_BUILD_NUMBER . # authenticate with the Azure Container Registry - docker login ekilabhub.azurecr.io --username ekilabhub --password $AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD # push the new Docker image to the registry - docker push ekilabhub.azurecr.io/ekilab/ekilab-demo-container:$BITBUCKET_BUILD_NUMBER - step: name: Deploying App to Azure script: # Install the Azure CLI - curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | bash # login with a Service Principal / store the credentials in a secured area - az login --service-principal --username $AZURE_APP_ID --password $AZURE_PASSWORD --tenant $AZURE_TENANT_ID # Set the correct image version to the web app - az webapp config container set --resource-group $AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP --name ekilab-demo-app --docker-custom-image-name ekilab-demo-container:$BITBUCKET_BUILD_NUMBER --docker-registry-server-url ekilabhub.azurecr.io --docker-registry-server-user ekilabhub --docker-registry-server-password $AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD What's next ?​ Congratulations ! You should now be able to automate the deployment of your app to the cloud and focus only on updating its content without worrying about how to publish your updates. Now, you might need to have a scalable app to ensure it can handle high loads of visits. You could require tools like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm.

We show that the attention coefficients specific to BERT architecture constitute a particularly rich piece of information that can be used to perform interpretability. There are mainly two ways to do interpretability: attribution and generation of counterfactual examples. In a first article, we showed how attention coefficients could be the basis of an attribution interpretability method. Here we propose to evaluate how they can also be used to set up counterfactuals. Work presented in the previous article​ Previously, the BERT [1] and DistilBERT [2] models have been mobilized to tackle the well-known problem of sentiment analysis. In particular, we have shown that the BERT and DistilBERT models contain within their architecture attention coefficients that can be at the heart of an attribution interpretability method. Starting from an initial text, a visualization of the weight assignment method was proposed. The more red the color, the higher the associated attention coefficient. Figure 1 - Attention-Based token importance We saw that the word groups &quot;favorite movie&quot;, &quot;it just never gets old&quot;, &quot;performance brings tears&quot;, or &quot;it is believable and startling&quot; stood out. This explained well why the algorithm evaluated the review as positive and what was the semantic field at the root of this prediction. This work was done using the Hugging Face transformers library [3]. Interpreting through counterfactual generation​ Another way to do interpretability is to generate counterfactual examples. According to Judea Pearl, counterfactual &quot;involves answering questions which ask what might have been, had circumstances been different” [4]. Thus, the idea is to understand a prediction by generating a counterfactual example, resulting in an opposite prediction. In the context of natural language processing, it is therefore a matter of changing the right words in the review. In order to generate a counterfactual example, we propose the following methodology: Compute the attention coefficients of the tokens in a text corpus on each attention layer (6). The text corpus size must be statistically significant Perform token clustering based on their 6-dimensional representationDetect clusters associated with positively and negatively charged sentiment wordsReplace the tokens with the highest average attention with their &quot;opposite token&quot; in their &quot;opposite cluster&quot; This approach allows us to validate the interpretative strength of the tokens put forward by the attention coefficients, while illustrating what a close review would have been with an opposite sentiment. We apply the methodology on a corpus of 1000 reviews. The clustering method used is the hierarchical ascending classification (HAC) and gives 3 clusters. The obtained clusters and the counterfactual generation procedure can be represented in 2 dimensions as follows: Figure 2 - Token clusters &amp; replacements We then generate the counterfactual example of the review tested earlier by changing 2 words: delight ➡ torment favorite ➡ worst This gives us the following counterfactual example: “Probably my all time worst movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause but its not preachy or boring . it just never gets old despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years . paul lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a torment. the kids are as grandma says more like dressedup midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch . and the mothers slow awakening to whats happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling . if i had a dozen thumbs they’d all be up for this movie&quot;. As the text is quite long, 2 tokens are not enough to change the feeling associated with the review. The probability score nevertheless drops significantly by 0.3pts. One way to assess the quality of the generated counterfactual examples is to evaluate the proportion of reviews in a corpus whose associated sentiment has changed. The result can be represented as a &quot;counterfactual confusion matrix&quot; as follows: One way to assess the quality of the generated counterfactual examples is to evaluate the proportion of reviews in a corpus whose associated sentiment has changed. The result can be represented as a &quot;counterfactual confusion matrix&quot; as follows: Table 1 - Counterfactual confusion matrix example Where : X11 represents the share of reviews whose initial associated sentiment and the sentiment of the counterfactual example are positive; sentiment has remained the same X12 represents the share of reviews whose sentiment changed from positive to negative; sentiment did change X21 represents the share of reviews whose sentiment changed from negative to positive; sentiment changed wellX22 represents the share of reviews whose initial associated sentiment and the sentiment of the counterfactual example are negative; sentiment has remained the same We compute the &quot;counterfactual confusion matrix&quot; on the same text corpus that enabled us to perform clustering, picking 5 tokens for each review. The result is given below: Table 2 - Actual counterfactual confusion matrix Thus, we see that changing the 5 tokens with the highest average attention produces a change in sentiment perception in 44% of cases. In particular, the rate of sentiment change for reviews initially perceived as positive is 31% while the rate of sentiment change for reviews initially perceived as negative is 53%. The change from negative to positive seems to be better achieved with our method. We have shown that attention coefficients can be a source of interpretability. Used in the right way, the attention coefficients allow the detection of tokens with high predictive value. They can also be used to generate counterfactual examples in order to better understand what the sentence should have been in order to be associated with an opposite sentiment. The interest of the attention coefficients is reinforced by the &quot;counterfactual confusion matrix&quot;: The high transformation rate of the reviews' sentiments shows that the tokens selected thanks to the attention are strongly meaningful. Next step​ We plan to test other ways to generate counterfactual examples. One way would be to take advantage of the way DistilBert has been trained: the mask language modeling (MLM). The idea would be to mask the tokens with high average attention, and replace them with the tokens with the highest softmax in the &quot;opposite cluster&quot;. This would ensure the grammatical correctness of the generated counterfactual example. Finally, the generation of counterfactual examples can have other applications than interpretability. In particular, it becomes possible to perform data augmentation in order to give more examples to a model. It can mitigate biases by balancing the sentiments of biased discriminated populations. This would improve fairness indicators while not degrading accuracy. References​ [1] VASWANI, Ashish, SHAZEER, Noam, PARMAR, Niki, et al. Attention is all you need.

The neural networks represent a subset of machine learning algorithms. In order to perform a learning task, the neural network spreads information through an elementary network, called a perceptron. The way in which information is diffused can be formalized through linear algebra and the manipulation of various activation functions. A neural network can be defined as an association of elementary objects called formal neurons, like the perceptron. There are several types of layers that can be part of a neural network: Fully connected layers, which receive a vector as input, and produce a new vector as output by applying a linear combination and possibly an activation function;Convolution layers, which learn localized patterns in space;Attention layers, which model the general relations between different objects. Attention mechanisms are particularly effective for natural language processing tasks. This is mainly due to the fact that they allow to properly model a word through mathematical representations. In particular, attention layers make it possible to assign a contextual representation of the word on a case-by-case basis. This makes it a much more efficient tool than Word2vec since the latter only models an average context, but does not adapt to the given situation. Attention mechanisms are at the heart of Transformers-type models as shown in the diagram below. The BERT model corresponds to a stack of the left part of the generic architecture of a Transformer [1]. Figure 1 - Transformers architecture "},{"title":"Fine tuning of BERT for sentiment analysis​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Interpreting its sentiment analysis algorithm: BERT and its attention coefficients (1/2)","url":"blog/2022/10/18/Interpretability_sentiment_analysis_I#fine-tuning-of-bert-for-sentiment-analysis","content":"To illustrate how attention coefficients can be a source of interpretability in natural language processing, we propose to fine tune a DistilBERT for sentiment analysis. A DistilBERT is a distilled version of BERT. It is smaller, faster, cheaper, lighter and recovers 97% of BERT’s performance on GLUE [2]. A perfect compromise, in fact. Most transformers are available pre-trained on the Hugging Face transformers library [3]. The objective is to perform supervised classification on the IMDB database to assess the sentiment associated with a movie review. An illustration of the dataset is shown below: Figure 2 - IMDB sample To do so, we import all the libraries needed. In particular, the tokenizer DistilBertTokenizer and the pre-trained hugging face model TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification are used. tokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained('distilbert-base-uncased') sentence_encoder = TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('distilbert-base-uncased', output_attentions = True) The parameter &quot;output_attention&quot; must be equal to &quot;True&quot;. It will allow us to retrieve the attention coefficients of the model. We add a dense layer with a softmax activation to fine tune the model to do sentiment analysis. In order to train the model, we use the following hyperparameters: initial_lr = 1e-5n_epochs = 15batch_size = 64random_seed = 42 Finally, we make evolve the learning and stop the learning process if the val_loss does not decrease after a certain number of iterations. reduce_lr = ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='val_loss', factor=0.2, verbose = 1,min_delta=0.005,patience=3, min_lr=3e-7) early_stop = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', min_delta=0, patience=6, verbose=1, mode='auto',baseline=None, restore_best_weights=True) We can finally fine tune the DistilBert. history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=bs, epochs=n_epochs, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), verbose=1,callbacks=[early_stop, reduce_lr]) We obtain a val_accurcay of 85%, which is sufficient for our further analysis. Note that a BERT or a RoBERTa would have certainly had a better val_loss, as they are more heavy and complex. Recovery of attention coefficients​ We are now able to analyze the attention coefficients related to movie reviews. In order to retrieve it, We need to predict the sentiment associated to a review. Then, we select the layer(s) of attention to analyze. We focus here on the last layer of attention. inputs = tokenizer.batch_encode_plus(reviews,truncation=True, add_special_tokens = True, max_length = max_len, pad_to_max_length = True) tokenized = np.array(inputs[&quot;input_ids&quot;]).astype(&quot;int32&quot;) attention_mask = np.array(inputs[&quot;attention_mask&quot;]).astype(&quot;int32&quot;) encoded_att = model.layers[2](tokenized,attention_mask =attention_mask) #last attention layer last_attention=encoded_att.attentions[-1] We finally recovered the 12 attention matrices from the last layer of the DistilBert. Interpreting through attention attribution​ A first way to take advantage of the attention coefficients is to directly look at their value in order to evaluate if the right words stand out. We choose to calculate the average attention on all attention layers and heads. A more in-depth work of selection of the most relevant layer would allow to refine the interpretability method. Here, we limit ourselves to the most basic case. a,b = [], [] for head in range(0,12) : for i, elt in enumerate(inputs['input_ids'][0]): if np.array(elt) != 1: att = last_attention.numpy()[0,head][0][i] a.append(tokenizer.decode([elt]) + '_' + str(i)) b.append(att) attention_all_head=pd.DataFrame({&quot;Token&quot;:a,&quot;Attention coefficient&quot;:b}) In order to have the average attention, we group by the attention score on all the layers and heads. We finally have the average attention coefficients associated with the words of the film review. As an example, the attention coefficients associated with the following positive review is calculated: “Probably my all time favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause but its not preachy or boring . it just never gets old despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years . paul lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a delight . the kids are as grandma says more like dressedup midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch . and the mothers slow awakening to whats happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling . if i had a dozen thumbs they’d all be up for this movie&quot;. The review being long, we represent the text in color. The more red the color, the higher the associated attention coefficient. The result is shown below: Figure 3 - Attention-Based token importance We see that the word groups &quot;favorite movie&quot;, &quot;it just never gets old&quot;, &quot;performance brings tears&quot;, or &quot;it is believable and startling&quot; stand out. This explains well why the algorithm evaluated the review as positive and what was the semantic field at the root of this prediction. Next step​ We will show in a future article how attention coefficients are useful for generating counterfactual examples to explain the model prediction.

The selection of these models was based on the criteria of model stability (high R2, no autocorrelation, controlled heteroskedasticity) and enough variation in social activity (spend and impressions threshold of 5% per object). Some of the modelling periods were cut to account for sparse data, low correlation between creative impressions and modelled impressions or low variation. Therefore, a trusted relationship from social to the KPI of each MMM was established but could be enhanced by choosing more accurate parameterization of Meta activity through MMM model optimisation. Table 1 details the models included in the study.   Table 1: Specifications of MMM models selected Detail of Models selected  Once the MMM models were optimized, we isolated the impact of Meta on the KPI according to the following relationship: Meta Contribution to KPI = Coefficient of Meta Variable ×Transformed Meta Variable The Meta contribution became the dependent variable of the Sub-Model, along with the constant and residuals. The object detection impressions timeseries served as the explanatory variables. The objective of this was to understand the impact of different feature splits into the overall Meta performance, allowing room for movement through the constant and residuals. A sub-modelling approach allowed for the object detection features to have indirect effects on the KPI, through the Meta variable. Bayesian Optimisation Methods were employed to find the optimal transformations for each variable. Each Sub-model is a linear regression, testing the impact of the appearance of a feature, or feature group, and its opposite (partner feature) against the total Meta performance. Since the features are not mutually exclusive (between 48%-66% of creatives contained at least two objects), they could not all be tested in the same model. Furthermore, the daily impressions and spend per feature were split according to creative type. That is, the impressions associated with a feature or combination of features, e.g., Person &amp; Product, were split out by static, video and carousel. While it was not in the scope of the study, doing this allowed for further analysis into the impact of features by creative type. A sequential approach was followed in which each feature group was tested in isolation. Within each sub-model, the transformations of the features (lag, adstock, and diminishing returns) which maximized R2, and minimized p-values were chosen. The transformations that the Meta features follow were bounded to the following ranges: lag of 0-3, adstock of 0-50, saturation (K; S) of 0.1-0.8; 1-9. An example of sub-model is shown below. Where: Same for Video (V) and Carousel (C) One major challenge with the approach of testing the appearance of a feature or a set of features against its partner feature (e.g., impressions of creatives where a Brand Cue appears vs impressions of creatives where a Brand Cue does not appear), is that the partner feature is indirectly testing the appearance of other features or no features at all. To manage the risk of results inaccuracy we made sure that: Both the main feature and the partner feature in the sub-models had to be statistically significant at a 10% level. For example, if the appearance of a feature is significant but the partner is not, the results of that regression were not used.The percent of Impressions of the feature being tested had to be &gt; 5% "},{"title":"ROI Calculations​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Exploring the links between creative execution and marketing effectiveness - Part IV: MMM for Creative Marketing Effectiveness","url":"blog/2023/01/15/creative_execution_and_marketing_effectiveness_part_IV#roi-calculations","content":"The last step of the analysis centred around calculating ROIs and deriving ROI uplifts for each feature per brand, using the feature contributions from the sub-models and the associated spend.

Adding more labels in the middle of the study would involve having to go back to time consuming tasks, such as manual labelling and repeated extraction and processing of labels. Ambiguous Object Definitions: Describe clearly from the start what each label is (e.g., “Person” can be any body part, not just a whole body with a face). This is helpful when the manual labelling is being done as a team, rather than by one person. Furthermore, if using a pre-trained model, ensure that your definition of the object aligns with what is detected by the model. For example, you may define “Car” as just the outside of the car while the OD model is trained to detect both the interior and exterior of cars. Non-Generalizable Labels: If you are studying two separate sub-brands within one brand, it is advisable to have two separate studies, rather than one. That is, instead of defining objects “Brand A Logo” and “Brand B Logo”, it may be better to separate the brands into different streams and have the same object labels for both (e.g., logo, brand cue, product and person). This will ensure that you code is reusable for studies of brands that have different numbers of sub-brands. Lazy Manual Labelling: Make sure to manually label all objects in a creative. For example, if there are three cars, label all of them, not just one. The manually labelled validation set is the ground truth against which a model’s performance is compared. If some objects are missed, you may have strange performance results that indicate that the model may be over-detecting objects. Trying to be Exhaustive: Avoid testing all open-source resources available, as this can be very time-consuming and not very fruitful. Choose two or three to test and instead spend more time on what you can do to improve their performance on your particular dataset. This could, for example, be done through hyperparameter tuning (e.g., testing different learning rates, batch sizes, confidence thresholds, etc.) or in the processing of the results (e.g., correcting any text labels inside logos or products). Lack of Checkpoints: Due to the many different data manipulation steps in this project, there are a lot of potential sources for errors. The key is to set up automatic checks at each stage to avoid a trickle down effect of avoidable errors. For example, removing false positives in face detection by only ‘accepting’ a detected face if a person was also detected in the creative will ensure that the feature time series that is used for MMM does not suddenly have more impressions for faces than for people. Similarly, when doing the feature engineering, employing a simple method of checking that there are no negative values, no missing data, and that the impressions and spend data is consistent across each sub-model will ensure that time is not wasted in the MMM stage from modelling with incorrect data. Key Paths to Success​ There are various components that can contribute to successfully executing this type of study, ranging from technical requirements to general strategies. Some of the key components are outlined below. Integrated, Efficient Tools​ Choosing the right tools can make or break a project of this complexity. Choose a platform which offers robust functionalities to help streamline and facilitate work. This study used Azure, but GCP is another great alternative. The key features that are required are: Cloud storage: Due to the volume of creatives included in this study, cloud storage was crucial. Particularly if extracting frames from videos, it is important to account for the significant volume of additional images that need to be stored. This project used Azure Storage. Labelling Software: The labelling process is very manual and time-consuming. Having an intuitive software that can import creatives directly from the cloud storage saves a lot of time and effort and avoids unnecessary duplication of images. Furthermore, the software should be able to export the labels as a JSON file which can then later be converted to the required format (e.g., COCO for Detectron2). For this project, the Azure Machine Learning Studio Data Labelling functionality was used. External Computation Resources: As the training, validation and final labelling of images are all computationally expensive processes, the use of external computation resources (clusters) is recommended. The configuration of the clusters can vary depending on the task at hand. For pre-processing and feature engineering, individual CPU-enabled single-node clusters are sufficient. On the other hand, for the training, validation, and labelling processes, it is recommended to use GPU-enabled clusters. While GPUs are a more expensive resources than CPUs, the efficiency gains may make up for the additional cost per hour. For this project, Databricks was used as it can connect to Azure storage, facilitates the use of clusters, supports various programming languages, and allows for collaboration on Notebooks. Contextual Knowledge​ Having a strong understanding of the brand acts as a crucial foundation for every step of this project. It is not only required for making informed decisions regarding which objects should be detected but also vital for defining the features to be measured in the MMM. For example, knowing that products often appear in creatives alongside just a hand raises the question of whether this is the most effective use of a person, or if including the person’s face would be more effective; this in turn leads to the creation of features testing products alongside ‘face-less’ people vs. people with faces. Contextual knowledge can also be gained throughout the project by stopping to analyse the data. For example, checking the distributions of manually labelled objects can give an early indication of performance of custom-trained models (feasibility for successful training and detection) as well as the expected impact for regression models. Strong Base Models​ Having strong base models is also key for success in this project. Since the target variable of the sub-models is determined by the contribution of the Meta variables in the base model, a poor base model will directly impact the performance of the sub-model. The quality of the base model will largely depend on the dataset used, so ensuring that sufficient, relevant, and good quality data relating to the baseline, market variations, and marketing activity is crucial. Programmatic Sub-Modelling​ Depending on the number of feature groups, KPIs and sub-brands included in the study, it may be infeasible to run the sub-models on a one-by-one basis. For context, this project had 156 sub-models (13 base models x 12 feature groups). For that reason, it is recommended to create a methodology that allows for the programmatic creation of sub-models.

The tool facilitates the interactive selection of the region of interest, and the labeling of said region with a pre-defined object label, as shown in Figure 1.   Figure 1 - Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio Image labeling Tool. Source: Microsoft.  Before undertaking the task of manually labeling images, and specially if it is done by a team of people and not a single person, it is advisable to have a pre-defined set of rules on how to approach the task. For example: when labeling “Person”, will you label only whole people? Or would you also label body parts as &quot;Person&quot;? Or at least those that show a face? - It is also important to ensure that all relevant objects in an image are labeled, specially in the validation data set, since that will constitute the ground truth when it comes to evaluating the performance of Object Detection models. When this is not done carefully, it becomes a problem, as some OD models might actually detect more objects than those which have been manually labeled. Distribution of Objects in Manually labeled Data set and Implications for the labeling of the Unlabeled Data set​ The train, validation and unlabeled data sets were created by taking random samples of all the creatives. This strategy generated a training and validation set that have very close matching distributions of the labels of interest, as shown in Figure 2. Therefore, we assessed that it is likely that the performance of the models (pre-trained or custom) on the validation data sets will be transferable to the unlabeled data sets.   Figure 2 - The distribution of labeled objects in the Train (outer) and Validation (inner) data sets.

In particular, the Confidence Scores (figure 8) that lead to the high Accuracies in figure 7 range from between 80% to 98%. As we developed our methodology to be applicable regardless of the industry, we needed to choose a Confidence Score Threshold of Acceptance that is high enough to ensure accuracy, but not too high that it would miss objects of interest entirely. Therefore, a threshold of 85% confidence was selected. Figure 7 - Accuracy of Faster R-CNN X 101 32x8d FPN 3x on Specific Object Types.  Figure 8 - Average Confidence of Faster R-CNN X 101 32x8d FPN 3x on Specific Object Types.

Figure 9 shows the performance of Faster R-CNN X 101 32x8d FPN 3x (Model 3). The confidence scores do not differ significantly between frames and still images (at most 1.4% points). This means that the model can recognise object of interest with equal confidence in both types of images. The differences in performance may be attributed to people in frames more often being close-up; cartoons appear in frames while they are absent in stills; and frames of cars over-index on close-up shots and interior shots.

It is implemented in PyTorch, and includes state-of-the-art algorithms like RetinaNet, Mask R-CNN, TensorMark and Faster R-CNN. Its training pipeline is GPU-run, making it fast and highly scalable. Furthermore, its modular nature allows for custom models to be created within an existing object detection framework. As a result, it was more suited for the needs of this study than other common object detection libraries like Yolov4. For both the pre-trained and custom models, a Faster R-CNN algorithm was used due to its speed and high performance on small object detection. This algorithm combines two network models: Fast R-CNN (Region based Convolutional Neural Network), a deep learning algorithm which generates a convolutional feature map, and RPN (Regi on Proposal Networks), a convolutional network that proposes regions. The specific model used was Faster R-CNN X 101 32x8d FPN 3x, a Faster R-CNN model developed by Detectron2 which uses a FPN (Feature Pyramid Networks) backbone, and a learning rate schedule of 3x. This model was chosen based on the baseline performances reported by FAIR, which highlight this model as having the highest average precision and training memory. For more information. Furthermore, the model was tested and evaluated against the performance of other Faster R-CNN models on objects the models are pre-trained on, against out Validation set. Figure 6 shows the results.

Therefore, it was necessary to manipulate the bounding boxes as follows (figure 10): In order to train the Custom-Trained Models, the Azure format was converted to the Detectron2 format: COCO bounding box (bbox) is defined as [x_min, y_min, width, height]. JSON files exported from Azure Data labeling have bounding boxes that are normalised. Detectron2 expect the bounding boxes in absolute values. Therefore, we transformed the attribute 'bbox' of the COCO file downloaded from Azure ML Studio to denormalise it, and added the 'bbox_mode' attribute to be equal to 1 (XYWH_ABS 0). We also add the pair &quot;iscrowd:0&quot; to each annotation [8]. In order to limit the region in images for text detection to outside of Logo and Product objects, Detectron2 format was transformed to Tesseract format: Detectron2 format [X, Y, W, H] to the Tesseract format (x1=X, x2=W+X, y1=Y, y2=H+Y).

Figure 11 shows some of the libraries available, as well as those we tested. Figure 11 - Open libraries with pre-trained models that detect faces and smiles, and those we tested.  We tested three different open libraries that are optimised for face detection. The Haar Cascades model has two parameters that need to be optimised, so we set up two sets of 52 experiments to find the optimum models that detect Faces and Smiles. Visually, it was clear that the models had a very high rate of False Positives, therefore we enhanced the detection algorithm by limiting the detection zone for smiles to be only inside the bounding boxes of faces, as shown in figure 12.   Figure 12 - Smiles being detected inside faces only was a necessary methodology we implemented, to improve the accuracy of open libraries that detect faces and smiles.  Furthermore, as there were no ready-made functions in the libraries to assess the performance of predictions, we developed a method that compared the intersection of the bounding boxes between of the manually labeled and predicted objects, as shown in figure 13. All the models tested suffered from having a high False Positive Rate. The best performing model was with library DLIB, with an Accuracy of 59%, a True Positive Rate of 41% and a False Positive Rate of 36%. Therefore, we needed a better methodology for detecting Faces and Smiles, so we tested training a custom Detectron2 model to do so, as described in Part III of this series.   Figure 13 - Methodology for assessing whether a predicted label for Face or Smile is accurate. Blue boxes indicate the bounding box of manually labeled objects. Yellow boxes indicate those for predicted objects. The grey area indicates the Region of Intersection (ROI). If the grey areas are between 60% and 130% of the size of the manually labeled object’s bounding box, the predicted label was considered to be accurate.

Data’s journey, from source to usage A data platform is highly versatile in providing technical options the five steps above. Getting your data from one step to the next means applying a strategy for how the data input is stored, how it is processed and how the output is exposed for the next step. These strategies will vary depending on the use case and platform, taking business as well as technical constraints in consideration. Designing your datalake’s strategies to be versatile and homogeneous is essential. It allows your data platform to grow fast, in terms of data content as well as use case possibilities. It also ensures that the datalake is under control with a common way of treating data, where its only varying specifities are the entry point (data sources) and output (serving layer). At Ekimetrics, we’ve developed versatile strategies that are applicable to most common use cases, easily reproducible.

The other steps are more straightforward: Data sources are usually out of the architect or data engineer’s control, as they often sit outside of the data platform (e.g. on a third-party server).Ingestion is a step for which design questions around data validation &amp; organization processes may be worth considering. We’ve talked about these processes in the first part of our “Building a datalake” articles. As for streaming vs batch, it is only dependent on the source: if the source system is streaming data, a resource to ingest that is necessary ; otherwise, recurrent batch ingestion is the go-to.Serving will depend on the target use case, so even if there are important design decisions to make, they will only be impactful in the scope of their use case, not for the whole datalake.Usage will most of the time be outside the datalake and depend on the use case. The few design decisions that may be necessary here won’t be as impactful to the datalake’s usability and usefulness either. Of course, this is not to say that designing relevant strategies and architecture for these steps doesn’t matter: they must be tailored to the business case and technical constraints. On the flipside, the Data storage and processing step is the central piece in the datalake puzzle. It is where storage and compute strategies will be the most impactful. What could it look like, then ? Inside this central step, data transits through four zones, from its raw form to fully processed for a particular use case, ready to serve to your businesses. These four zones are detailed below, in between ingestion and serving. Data storage and processing - storage zones These zones can be found under various names: Landing - Bronze - Silver - Gold, or Temp - Raw - Cleaned - Conformed, etc. The intent is the same, where data becomes more and more usable and business use case oriented with each zone. In between each storage zone, organization and transformation processes are applied to organize and extract insights out of data. This is where our storage and computing strategies come in.

In these two cases, the ingestion strategy we recommend results in the same outcome. Here the strategy is to historize all received data, adding metadata about its reception date (or validity date) through organization in the storage architecture or in the dataset itself. The RAW storage zone becomes a source of historical knowledge about all data points and their changes through time. Doing this, we’re also able to add a “slowly changing dimension” / “change data capture” aspect to our data, where we can easily find a data point’s values at any moment in time. Fig. 1: Computing &amp; storage strategies in between Landing and Raw zones note There are limitations to historizing all received data, notably storage costs: this is where the data’s lifecycle must be discussed. Keeping all older versions of a single dataset may start to become expensive as the data piles up, outweighing the pros if only the latest values are used. In this case, a solution can be to keep only the latest values of the source’s data points, or just one version of the source every N periods on top of the latest ones. We can then archive older and unused versions in cold, less costly storage resources. The archived data enters a different lifecycle, where it could be removed at some point in the future if it doesn’t serve any business purpose. The “historize everything” strategy ensures RAW storage is the most useful it can be: use case agnostic, your businesses can use and explore the data at its full potential. It also helps unify the way RAW storage is meant to be read by your later processes, improving usability while allowing for costs optimization without sacrificing the underlying principle.

We’re also able to use older data to track changes and generate insights from these.

For instance, we could update the current month’s exposed insights each day, then stop updating it at the end of the month, writing a new one for the next month’s computed insights, and so on. note Historizing our transformations and results is useful for debugging and business exploration, but iterations may start to pile up, so defining a lifecycle for Trusted (TRD) and Refined (RFD) storage is important as well: do our technical processes or business use cases need all the iterations history stored in trusted TRD ? Can our business use cases work with a simplification of RFD storage, similar to the Delta historization for RAW zone in figure 1 ? You may have noticed, our exposed Refined storage looks strangely similar to what we had in the data source: we’re exposing either the full up-to-date version of our insights, or just updates and new ones, just like our sources. The datalake is now a source for your business’ use cases, so it makes sense that it would be able to expose data in a similar way. The “up-to-date view” strategy is highly useful for most use cases, and through smart use of historization, still allows for your businesses to get insights on the data’s evolution through time. It also ensures versatility in making your datalake a usable source for other systems when exposing data. From there, the serving layer can leverage this source in a wide range of solutions, be it a database, reporting, CRM, AI models, etc.  "},{"title":"Conclusion​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Building a datalake - Part 2 - Smart storage & computing strategies for better usability and usefulness","url":"blog/2023/02/28/building_datalake_part_2#conclusion","content":"In essence, storage &amp; compute strategies can be sumarized in three questions: Why are these strategies necessary: to ensure versatility for businesses and technical processes, all the while improving usability.How do they do that: by capturing and organizing data’s history efficiently, unifying the way we look at data while allowing for versatility in its usage.What they mean: a unified, highly useful and usable storage, and computing that help the datalake become the source for a wide range of systems and use cases.

We also work on GCP and Cloud Dataflow, where Apache Beam provides the same flexibility to process streams as well as batches. But IT teams ans Business teams are so used to batch analytics that it is hard to convey the value of real-time or up-to-date analytics, even though we now have platforms to handle the sources that can stream data. And with the emergence of micro-services, we also have more and more of these sources. Based on current market evolutions and on our previsions: Companies should create real-time views of customers, products, suppliers and production plans on an easy-to-grow platform with the adequate governance,Companies should assemble a real-time analytical view of their whole business to be able to steer it appropriately, Because this article is about real-time analytics, it starts with the definition of these terms. We use the example of driving a car as parallel for running a company. We all drive cars, we all see cars change, for example from “manual gearbox” to “automatic gearbox” to “no more gearbox”, and we all have a lot of knowledge about cars. Car technology will be used in this article to illustrate the following questions: What is the minimal data available to drive a car and what is the benefit of additional data ?How to transpose for example the ABS of a car into a platform to help drive a company ?

Real-time, as separated from Batch, is related to processing: Batch processing is about processing data on a schedule, between every few hours and every month. Users gets an image that is always a bit old, but for many businesses and operations this is seen as acceptable, Real-time processing is about reflecting the current status of the operations. The latency depends of the source rather than the processing, it is between a few seconds and a few hours depending on the capability of the source system. When analyzing a business process, it is always a very interesting exercise to diagnose if a certain metric is operational or analytic. And if the data is analytic, the next question is to wonder if the business could benefit from having that metric in real-time.

No electronics in there, this is pure mechanics and a few electrical wires, an ideal starting point for our journey ! What data do you have to drive a Citroën 2CV? Speed, battery level, gas levels, total mileage, that’s it. And the engine is so noisy that there is no need for an engine RPM meter ! According to the definitions above, the data is the direct readings of the mechanical operations of the car, for example from the speed of the wheels, so this is operational data. No further processing here, so no analytical data at all. Finally, let’s introduce this diagram of the car with no Analytics at all: How does driving a 2CV transpose to driving a company?​ When we transpose to driving a company, operational data is the data that resides in the operational systems, such a CRMs and ERPs. It contains all the referential and transactional information necessary to run the company, from HR to Sales to Finance. All reports and dashboards that are directly embedded in these applications or close to them are also considered operational data. Since there is enough information to run the business, we can jump to our first conclusion:  "},{"title":"Born in the 80s and mandatory in EU in 2003, the ABS​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Does your company level with your car in terms of Analytics?","url":"blog/2023/03/07/level_car_analytics#born-in-the-80s-and-mandatory-in-eu-in-2003-the-abs","content":"The ABS, or Anti-lock Braking System, measures the speed of each wheel and reduces the pressure on the brakes to avoid the wheel locking up when losing grip. To brake efficiently, it applies “threshold braking” and “cadence braking” that are techniques of the most skillful drivers, taken here at a much faster rate than what these drivers can perform. What is real-time analytical processing of operational data in a business?​ If we change the wheels of the cars by the BUs of a company, we get to a functional diagrams like the one below, where each BU includes efficient controls applied in real-time on the data from the operations: Data Science is applied locally on the operational data, for purposes like segmentation, scoring, pricing and other applications of Machine Learning. The purpose here is to get value from investments in each BU, but there are no insights to make the whole bigger than the sum of its parts. It is like in the example of the ABS, we want to replicate the techniques of the best players, locally in each domain. It is important to note that local AI initiatives do not require a dedicated platform for analytical data and that improving the operations locally can be achieved in the operational applications. For example, SAP and Salesforce include more and more predictive features. And since these platform work on up-to-date information, embedding Machine Learning in operational systems is the closest to what ABS is in a car.

It leverages four wheel-speed sensors, the steering angle sensor and an inertial measurement unit to act on the break pressure of each wheel and engine acceleration command. Depending on the situation, it can reduce the speed of the engine and brake all wheels or activate the brake on only one wheel only to alter the heading of the car. The diagram changes, since all insights are now consolidated before they are processed: What does an ESP looks like in a company?​ In your company, we are leaving the territory of ERPs, because even SAP does not cover all aspects that must be monitored and given sense together. In addition, ERPs have many limitations regarding Advanced Analytics: ERPs are complex to query and it may impact production,ERPs don’t need and don’t keep history,ERPs don’t care about weak signals and don’t make sense of unstructured data,ERPs are not designed to consolidate data with other ERPs or other operational platforms,And lastly, when a change is interesting, it takes ages to impact ERPs. Because consolidation cannot occur in the operational systems, we introduce an additional data storage and processing layer called the analytical data plane . We assemble data platforms that can host data assets of different Business Units, with some local autonomy and some global governance, so insights can be derived from many elements. This is where the Lakehouse and the Federated Governance patterns apply. This is also where we believe we must now work in real-time, like in the ESP in the car analogy. The driving force is that the analytical plane should be up-to-date with the data that is shared from the operational systems, it should not add an hourly or a daily delay between the times it processes data. Most use-cases that we currently in batch will benefit from being executed with up-to-date data from the operations. Let’s take a two examples: The purpose of a Customer 360° use-case is to consolidate Transaction history, Social media presence, Customer support interactions, Segmentation history, Sensitivity to the promotions and prices, etc. into a single view of the customers. Having that information always up-to-date could let you, for example: Target, or restrain from targeting, in certain situations,Send messages at the right moment,Propose Next Best Action when the customer calls,etc. Expanding on that up-to-date Customer 360 and adding up-to-date supply-chain information and up-to-date suppliers information will enable new use-cases to better serve the customers needs. In addition to use cases, and if we consider a company as a complex system, it is important to monitor all its moving parts together to better understand its reactions. And when there are days or weeks between an action and the monitoring of its effect, it is more difficult to steer. For these reasons, we want to propose real-time as the new standard, today:  "},{"title":"Mandatory in 2022, AEB is the current state-of-the-art​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Does your company level with your car in terms of Analytics?","url":"blog/2023/03/07/level_car_analytics#mandatory-in-2022-aeb-is-the-current-state-of-the-art","content":"In addition to sensors that focus on the inside of the car, AEB (Automatic Emergency Braking) uses sensors that look outside of the car, like Front radar sensor, multi-purpose dashboard camera(s) and corner radar sensors.

It is an open-source resource, originally developed by Hewlett-Packard, and now managed by Google. This package does not have any parameters to optimise, but, as is exposed here, the basic performance of this resource can be improved with a combination of image processing and detected text correction. In this work, Tesseract was used to detect text in all images, in a process outlined in Figure 1. Performance of this detection tool was done using Confusion Matrices, to gain insight not only into the Accuracy, but also other metrics such as the True Positive and True Negative Rates. Figure 1 - Three stage process by which the basic performance (accuracy) of Tesseract on the original images was improved by up to 28% points.  To start with, the functionality was used on the original images to measure a baseline for performance on our sets of images. From this first step, we derived the following learnings: For general Text (both non-promotional Text and Promotional Text), the Accuracy is 69%, the True Positive Rate is around 65%, the False Positive Rate is about 35%.Tesseract does not recognise symbols such as % (which may indicate promotional text) accurately.Tesseract does not perform well on images that have a busy background.Tesseract does not recognise slanted Text. Based on the low total volume of Promotional Text in our dataset, as well as the poor performance of Tesseract to detect Promotional Text, the decision was made to remove Promotional Text as one of the desired objects to study. Building on those learnings, we implemented a pipeline, outlined in Figure 2, that would help us improve the performance from baseline, by up to 28 percentage points on Accuracy : Figure 2 - Pipeline for pre-processing images before Optical Character Recognition Models, and correcting detected text.  For Step 1, pre-processing methods included the following, as well as combinations of those (illustrated in Figure 3): Binary Threshold, Sharpen, Normalisation, Histogram Equalisation, Histogram Adaptive Equalisation. As can be imagined, a processing method that enhances the performance of the detection method for one image, might decrease it for different images. Therefore, to ensure we obtained the highest accuracy for all images, we applied all pre-processing methods to all images, running Tesseract on each modified image, and keeping track of the text detected in each iteration. Figure 3 - Effect of various image processing methods on the original. Images for illustrative purposes. Original images sourced from unsplash.com  In Step 2 we use Tesseract to detect text in the pre-processed images. Step 3 consisted of removing any “incorrect” text, such as text inside the bounding boxes of Logo or Product objects, if the text was shorter than a threshold length (which depended on the brand), if it consisted of keywords, such as the brand name, or if it had ASCII characters. With the current methodology (figure 2), the accuracy cannot be improved any further by changing the length of text that is considered to be “true” Text. Furthermore, there is a trade-off between the True Negative Rate and the True Positive Rate, which helped us choose a threshold for the length of string to accept: Since Accuracy does not improve further after length 4, but this value does optimise the other two metrics, 4 characters long is the threshold chosen.  The performance of Tesseract may be improved further by adding another step to the pipeline in figure 2, where the image is rotated several degrees, and after each rotation, text is detected. Due to time constraint issues, and the fact that we had already achieved a significant improvement above baseline and reached an accuracy of high 90s for some of the brands, we did not implement this step.

This paper presents a systematic framework for selecting between AI Models, AI Workflows, and AI Agents based on empirical evidence from production implementations across multiple industries. Our analysis demonstrates that architectural decisions should be driven by operational constraints and business requirements rather than technological novelty. We provide quantitative comparisons and decision criteria derived from real-world deployments in FinTech, Gaming, and Non-profit sectors. Architectural Taxonomy​ Following the widespread adoption of generative AI, two primary design patterns have emerged beyond direct model integration: AI Workflows, which employ orchestrated, deterministic processes, and AI Agents, which utilize autonomous, LLM-driven decision-making. These architectures represent distinct approaches to balancing development velocity, operational control, and system adaptability. Architectural Definitions​ AI Models: Direct integration of large language models without additional orchestration layers. Implementation involves prompt engineering and API integration for language generation tasks. Advantages: Minimal development overhead, cost-effective deploymentLimitations: Constrained transparency, absence of external system integration AI Workflows: Structured, deterministic sequences that orchestrate LLMs with complementary tools, APIs, and data sources through predefined logic. Advantages: High operational control, comprehensive auditability, regulatory complianceLimitations: Architectural rigidity, substantial upfront design requirements AI Agents: Systems employing LLM-driven reasoning for autonomous decision-making, dynamic tool selection, and adaptive behavior based on contextual analysis. Advantages: Flexible adaptation, complex task handling, conversational interaction patternsLimitations: Development complexity, elevated operational costs, reduced predictability Empirical Case Studies​ Implementation 1: Automated Climate Risk Assessment (FinTech)​ Technical Challenge: Systematic automation of climate risk assessments incorporating 200+ data points while maintaining regulatory compliance and audit requirements. Architectural Evaluation: AI Models: Rejected due to output inconsistency across execution cycles, incompatible with financial risk assessment standardsAI Agents: Excluded based on development timeline constraints (3-month delivery) and regulatory stability requirements Selected Architecture: AI WorkflowImplementation Details: Deterministic processing pipeline with embedded LLM components for structured reasoning and analysis. Quantitative Outcomes: Data integration: 200+ risk indicators per assessmentIndustry coverage: 1,023 ISIC-classified industriesAutomation rate: 100% (zero manual intervention required)Compliance: Full audit trail and expert validation integration Implementation 2: Natural Language Data Interface (Non-profit)​ Technical Challenge: Democratization of complex sustainability datasets for non-technical users through conversational interaction paradigms. Architectural Evaluation: AI Models: Insufficient for contextual memory and iterative query refinementAI Workflows: Inadequate for open-ended exploratory data analysis patterns Selected Architecture: AI AgentImplementation Details: Dynamic query generation with real-time visualization and iterative analytical refinement capabilities. Quantitative Outcomes: Query accuracy improvement: 40% over traditional SQL approachesExecution time reduction: 70% (average response time ~5 seconds)User accessibility: Enabled independent data exploration for non-technical stakeholdersScalability: Adaptive system growth alongside organizational data expansion Implementation 3: Text-to-SQL Interface (Gaming)​ Technical Challenge: Real-time data access for business users without SQL proficiency, integrated with existing communication infrastructure. Architectural Rationale: Predictable query patterns and accelerated delivery timeline favored architectural stability over adaptive capabilities. Selected Architecture: AI WorkflowImplementation Details: Structured text-to-SQL conversion with deterministic validation and comprehensive error handling mechanisms. Quantitative Outcomes: Efficiency improvement: 98% reduction in query resolution time (30 minutes to 30 seconds)SQL generation accuracy: 90% success rateSystem integration: Seamless messenger application compatibilityOperational impact: Elimination of IT team dependency for routine data requests Comparative Technical Analysis​ Evaluation Criteria\tAI Models\tAI Workflows\tAI AgentsDevelopment Timeline\tDays to Weeks\tWeeks to Months\tMonths Technical Complexity\tLow\tModerate\tHigh Operational Costs\tLow\tMedium\tHigh Output Determinism\tLimited\tHigh\tModerate System Explainability\tVariable\tHigh\tMedium Scalability Pattern\tVertical\tManual Extension\tAdaptive Evolution Integration Complexity\tMinimal\tModerate\tSubstantial Maintenance Overhead\tLow\tMedium\tHigh Implementation Guidelines​ Architectural Selection Principles​ Evidence-Based Decision Making: Architectural choices should be driven by empirical requirements analysis rather than technological trends or novelty considerations. Constraint-Driven Design: System architecture must align with operational constraints including timeline, budget, regulatory requirements, and organizational technical capabilities. Incremental Evolution Strategy: Successful implementations often follow a progression from simple model integration through structured workflows to adaptive agent systems based on validated user requirements. Common Implementation Patterns​ Hybrid Architecture Approaches: Production systems frequently combine elements from multiple architectural paradigms to optimize for specific functional requirements while maintaining overall system coherence. Progressive Enhancement: Organizations often begin with AI Model implementations for initial validation, evolve to AI Workflows for production stability, then selectively introduce AI Agent capabilities for complex interaction requirements. Risk-Adjusted Implementation: High-stakes applications typically favor deterministic workflow approaches, while exploratory or user-facing applications benefit from agent-based adaptive capabilities. Architectural Evolution Trajectory​ AI Models → AI Workflows → AI Agents ↑ ↑ ↑ Validation Production Adaptive Phase Stability Evolution Empirical evidence suggests that successful AI implementations often follow a maturation path from direct model integration through structured workflow orchestration to autonomous agent capabilities, with each phase addressing different organizational maturity and requirement complexity levels.

However, the fundamental design principles of constraint-driven selection, empirical validation, and incremental evolution remain constant. Organizations should focus on systematic requirement analysis, quantitative outcome measurement, and iterative architectural refinement rather than pursuing technological novelty for its own sake.

Yet, these marvels often lack a crucial human trait: the ability to say &quot;I don't know.&quot; While ANNs excel at making predictions, they struggle with uncertainty, confidently providing answers even when data is limited or unreliable. This can lead to misleading results, especially in critical areas where trust is paramount. Enter Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), a pioneering approach that embraces uncertainty as a strength. Inspired by Bayesian statistics, BNNs confidently acknowledge &quot;I don't know&quot; when the data gets hazy. This seemingly simple addition unlocks a treasure trove of benefits: Confidence, not certainty: BNNs don't just predict, they provide confidence intervals, allowing users to understand the level of trust they can place in each answer. This leads to more informed decision-making, especially in critical situations.Real-world robustness: Built to handle the noise and outliers inherent in real-world data, BNNs are more reliable in uncertain environments, offering more trustworthy results.Active learning: BNNs can pinpoint their areas of highest uncertainty, actively seeking out the most informative data points to refine their knowledge. This continuous learning loop makes them even more powerful. This fascinating world of BNNs holds immense potential, not just for improving traditional AI applications, but for building trust and transparency in a future increasingly reliant on artificial intelligence. As we delve deeper into their inner workings, explore their diverse applications, and discuss the exciting challenges and opportunities they present, be prepared to witness how &quot;I don't know&quot; becomes the secret weapon of the future's AI. Neural Networks Essentials In order to understand the way bayesian neural networks, we will have to dive into what bayesian neural networks are based on : artificial neural networks. Artificial neural networks are part of the Artificial Intelligence that aims at replicating the way human brain works, this field is also commonly called “Deep Learning”. An artificial neural network can be used for 2 main tasks : Classification: task where the network learns to map input data to discrete categories or classes. This is achieved through the training process, where the network adjusts its weights and biases to minimize the difference between predicted class probabilities and the actual class labels in the training data. Regression: task where the network is trained to predict a continuous output variable based on input data. In regression tasks, the network learns to capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, allowing it to make predictions on new, unseen data points. The training process involves minimizing the difference between predicted and actual continuous values. An artificial neural network will work this following way : The artificial neural network (ANNs) can be considered as a mathematical function where you put in input the features which will be useful to predict an output. ANNs are made up of interconnected nodes, called neurons, which process information and transmit it to other neurons. The neurons are arranged in layers, with each layer performing a different function. We can split layers into 3 categories : Input layer is the first layer, it will receive the input data . The input layer neurons then process the data and transmit it to the hidden layers.The hidden layers are the layers of an ANN that are not directly connected to the input or output layers. The hidden layers are responsible for learning complex patterns in the data. The hidden layers are also responsible for making predictions about the data.Output layer is the last layer, the one that predicts the desired output. Neurons (rounds in our schema) in ANNs work by: Receiving input signals: From other neurons.Multiplying input signals by weights: The weights determine the influence of each input signal on the neuron's output signal.Adding the weighted inputs: To produce a sum.Passing the sum to an activation function: Which produces the neuron's output signal. ANNs are trained by adjusting the weights of the neurons. The goal of the training process is to minimize the error between the predicted output of the ANN and the actual output of the ANN. Once the ANN is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data. The new data can be anything from images and sounds to text and sensor readings. The ANN will then produce an output for the new data. Now that we have a basic understanding of artificial neural networks (ANNs), let's discuss Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). BNNs are a type of ANN that uses Bayesian probability theory to represent uncertainty in the model's parameters. This allows BNNs to learn more robust models and make more accurate predictions, especially when dealing with limited or noisy data. Bayesian Neural Networks : &quot;I know that I know nothing&quot; Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) have emerged as a powerful solution to address a fundamental limitation of traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): the ability to express uncertainty. While ANNs are proficient at making predictions, they often lack the capability to quantify uncertainty or admit when they don't have enough information. BNNs, on the other hand, introduce a Bayesian framework that inherently accounts for uncertainty in the model parameters. Indeed, one key difference between ANNs and BNNs is that ANNs learn a single point estimate of the model's parameters, while BNNs learn a probability distribution over the model's parameters. By treating weights as probability distributions rather than fixed values, BNNs can express a range of possibilities for each weight, allowing them to convey a degree of uncertainty in their predictions. This inherent probabilistic nature makes BNNs more flexible and generic in handling situations where an ANN might simply provide a confident but potentially misguided answer. BNNs excel in scenarios where acknowledging uncertainty is crucial, providing a more nuanced and cautious approach compared to the deterministic nature of traditional ANNs. In essence, BNNs offer a valuable advancement by enabling neural networks to say, &quot;I don't know,&quot; thereby enhancing their applicability in real-world scenarios that demand a nuanced understanding of uncertainty. Conclusion In conclusion, while Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) present exciting possibilities in the realm of artificial intelligence, addressing challenges such as computational complexity and the need for efficient training algorithms is imperative for unlocking their full potential. The computational efficiency of BNNs, often demanding more resources than traditional ANNs, necessitates advancements in both hardware and algorithms to make them practical for real-world applications. Ongoing research focused on developing scalable training algorithms for BNNs is a key endeavor, with the promise of making these networks more accessible across various domains. Additionally, the interpretability of BNN outputs, despite their transparency in uncertainty quantification, requires further exploration to enhance widespread acceptance. On the flip side, exploring the applications of BNNs reveals their transformative impact across diverse fields. In medical diagnoses, BNNs offer transparency and caution, providing not only accurate predictions but also confidence intervals that empower healthcare professionals to make informed decisions. In the financial sector, BNNs excel at predicting market trends, offering confidence intervals that assist investors and analysts in navigating the inherently uncertain landscape. The cautious approach of BNNs is particularly valuable in the realm of autonomous vehicles, where real-time quantification of uncertainty enhances safety in unpredictable environments. Furthermore, BNNs play a crucial role in robotics, allowing robots equipped with these networks to navigate complex environments with sophistication, adapting to unforeseen obstacles and uncertainties in ways traditional neural networks cannot. As we navigate the evolving landscape of AI, Bayesian neural networks emerge as a beacon of progress, not just in making better predictions but in fostering trust, transparency, and adaptability. By embracing the notion of &quot;I don't know,&quot; BNNs illuminate a path toward collaborative interactions between AI systems and humans, providing nuanced and cautious insights in the face of uncertainty. The ongoing research and development in this field underscore the pivotal role that Bayesian neural networks are poised to play in shaping the next generation of intelligent systems.","keywords":"data science deep learning bayesian"},{"title":"CLAIR.bot: One Year of Responsible AI Serving Public Debate","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"blog/clair_anniversary","content":"Origins: AI to Inform, Demonstrate and Transform​ February 2024. Generative AI is everywhere. Since the release of ChatGPT, public opinion has swung between fascination and anxiety. Some predict the end of humanity; others foresee the solution to all our problems. At Ekimetrics—a mission-driven company and pioneer in responsible AI—we saw, amid the noise, an essential need: to create the foundations of a calm, informed, and nuanced dialogue. From this vision came CLAIR.bot. Designed as an open, free tool to help everyone better understand AI, CLAIR also plays an internal role: it showcases our technological expertise and our commitments to frugality, open source, and digital sovereignty. Inspired by ClimateQ&amp;A—a chatbot providing sourced answers about climate change—CLAIR tackles another major contemporary concern: artificial intelligence. Our ambition was twofold: to show that AI can serve the common good, and to offer an exemplary user experience from technical, ethical, and societal perspectives. All of this with a then-unique multi-agent vision. Purpose and Audience: A Tool for Everyone​ CLAIR is for anyone curious or concerned about AI: students and teachers looking for reliable references; journalists exploring complex concepts; companies monitoring risks and opportunities; and everyday citizens who are often curious, sometimes anxious, and frequently lost. The idea is simple: ask any question freely and receive a rich, contextualized, and multi-perspective answer. To do this, we built an interface featuring four specialized AI agents. Ada, the technical expert, answers scientific and technological questions. Norma focuses on standards, laws, and especially the European AI Act. Sophia handles ethics, social sciences, and the philosophy of technology. Finally, CLAIR synthesizes the three perspectives into a coherent summary. Each response is sourced, explainable, and traceable. The aim isn’t to deliver THE truth but rather a broad overview of viewpoints to encourage deeper understanding. Design and Challenges: From Multi-Agent to Technological Frugality​ Developing CLAIR.bot was an open-air laboratory that led us to make bold choices. We adopted a multi-agent architecture—one of the first of its kind in open-access—where each agent answers the question in parallel, drawing on its own specialized document base. Each agent also uses an agentic retrieval approach: independently running multiple dynamic searches based on the question, allowing for richer answers. A major UX/UI effort ensured users could view four distinct answers without feeling overwhelmed. CLAIR’s synthesis appears at the center, with the specialized agents displayed around it. We relied heavily on open-source technologies—for front-end, search, and embeddings—achieving excellent retrieval performance where open source often outshines proprietary alternatives. As for the language models, we initially used the best available, even proprietary ones, pending the emergence of more energy-efficient options. Alongside this, we implemented rigorous security measures: red teaming (including jailbreak tests), continuous monitoring (logs, latency, error rates, qualitative assessments), and even a CO2 tracker for every question asked, using Ecologits. By design, CLAIR.bot is GDPR-compliant, collects no personal data, and offers full transparency about its sources and usage terms. User Benefits: Accessibility, Responsibility, Clarity​ In a landscape often dominated by monolithic AI answers, CLAIR.bot stands out by offering nuanced information. Its design ensures explainability: each agent cites its sources and links directly to the documents consulted. It remains fully free, accessible to all, and respectful of privacy, inviting users to reflect rather than simply consume a ready-made answer. Feedback has shown that CLAIR reassures, demystifies, and makes AI understandable without oversimplifying. It serves as a kind of popular education, matching the scale of 21st-century challenges. One Year Later: Toward More Specialization and Frugality​ Since July 2024, CLAIR.bot has kept evolving. Ada now connects in real time to OpenAlex, accessing up-to-date scientific publications. Sophia will soon be able to consult an incident database to better assess social and ethical risks. For Norma, our roadmap aims to transform her into an online AI use case auditor, reasoning step by step through AI Act obligations. We are also investing in fine-tuning smaller models (like Gemma 9B) to replace models that pose ethical or environmental concerns. Other efforts include automatically measuring bias, toxicity, and factuality—combining human benchmarks with LLMs as evaluators—and designing a modular architecture ready to host new specialized agents in fields like health, climate, or labor law. CLAIR, a Compass in the AI Debate​ CLAIR isn’t an endpoint; it’s a beginning. In just twelve months, we’ve shown that it’s possible to build a different kind of AI: more responsible, more frugal, and more useful. CLAIR.bot remains a living project, constantly improving while staying true to its mission: revealing complexity, clarifying AI’s stakes, and opening debates rather than closing them.

If too long for you, just have a look at conclusion :-) Introduction​ A notable trend we have observed in generative AI for the last few years is the development of vision-language models (VLMs) which are just special versions of language models with ability to receive one – sometimes, several – image(s) as a new input, in addition to the textual input. Most ambitious closed-weight large language models (e.g. GPT-4o, Gemini Pro) now include vision capacities. Many “blind” open-weight language models have been used as starting points for new VLMs having more and more image understanding skills, such as LLaVA [1], CogVLM [2], PaliGemma [3], Phi-3-vision [4], Llama-3.2 [5] and Pixtral 12B [6]. Although the performance of VLMs across different vision tasks may be very irregular and sometimes disapointing (see for instance the OpenVLM Leaderboard), they are a new field of hope for various use cases such as accessibility improvement through image captioning, automated web user interface coding from mockup images, zero-shot rich feature extraction from images for machine learning, for retrieval-augmented generation or product catalog automation... In this article, we will not focus on potential use cases, but we will help you get a good (though certainly not comprehensive) and technical understanding of how vision-language models are built. Ingredients​ A common choice in reference papers we have gathered for this review (see last section: references), to build a VLM, is to combine two already trained models: a blind language model and an image encoder. The trained language model has a transformer decoder architecture, and has previously been trained in multiple steps, to be able to produce a relevant text, given an input text or sequence of texts, which may be an instruction, context data, chat history... Text generation is an iterative process: at inference time, the text is generated token per token (a token is a word or part of a word). At each generation iteration, the input of the model is made up of all prompted and previously generated tokens; each input token is converted to a token embedding (learnt during training, for all possible tokens in the token dictionary); then all token embeddings are analyzed and updated thanks to multiple transformer blocks. These blocks include masked self-attention layers, so that the model, to predict next token, can decide to pay different attention to any of the previous tokens. The trained image encoder has a transformer encoder architecture. As an input, it receives one image, which is divided into small patches (smaller images), as designed for Vision transformers [14]. These patches are gathered in a single sequence, and then go through a stack of transformer blocks which include a self-attention mechanism (attention between image patches at different positions in the original image). The output is a sequence of embeddings: one for each patch, which can be seen as a representation of the patch in the context of all other patches. Cross-attention vs. self-attention​ The first question you may ask is: how to plug these two deep learning models together? Well, two alternative solutions are implemented, and you know them: cross-attention vs. self-attention. Cross-attention, is the now commonly used name for encoder-decoder attention, as defined in the original transformer [7]. It is a way for a transformer decoder, at each position of its input sequence, to selectively pay attention to some of the embeddings produced by a separate encoder: it is the normal connection mode between a transformer decoder and a transformer encoder. So it seems to be the most natural way to teach the language model (decoder-only transformer) to pay attention to the image embeddings produced by the image encoder. Flamingo [8], OpenFlamingo [13] and LLama 3.2 [5] apply this cross-attention solution: cross-attention layers are inserted in the transformer blocks of the blind language model. Note that cross-attention is asymetrical: the representation of the image is not influenced by the text content. Note that with cross-attention between text and image, positional embeddings and self-attention masking strategies, previously defined in the image encoder and in the language model, are fully preserved. However, for interleaved texts and (possibly multiple) images, as in Flamingo [8], a special masking strategy can be defined in cross-attention, so that text tokens may pay attention to an image only if the image is before that text token in the interleaved content. Self-attention between text tokens and image patches seems counterintuitive, since image patch embeddings and text token embeddings are two different sequences in two different representation spaces. Yet, self-attention is the most commonly used way to condition text generation with information from image: it is applied in BLIP-2 [9], LLaMA-Adapter [10], MiniGPT-4 [11], LLaVA-NeXT [1], CogVLM2 [2], PaliGemma [3], Phi-3-vision [4], Pixtral [6]... The “trick” to make this possible is to add and train an adapter that converts the image patch embeddings into text token embeddings, which are inserted into the text sequence before the full sequence goes through all (or some) transformer blocks of the language model; different kinds of adapters have been experimented (see next section). After that conversion, the inserted converted embeddings are addressed just like text token embeddings, in the same self-attention layers and feed-forward (FF) layers of the language model; except for CogVLM [2] models, which use dedicated self-attention and FF weights for sequence positions coming from the image. Adopting this self-attention solution requires making decisions on the image token embeddings which are inserted in the text sequence: which position to assign them for position embedding? Must they follow a causal mask as for text tokens (i.e. each token can only see previous tokens in self-attention computation)? Only a few papers mentionned here are explicit on their choices. For instance, CogVLM [2] relies on a causal mask for image tokens, but for position embedding, all tokens from image share a single position identifier. In Pixtral [6], the image tokens are treated identically to the text tokens, including RoPE-1D positional encodings for all tokens, and causal self-attention. On the contrary, PaliGemma [3] avoids causal masking on image tokens. Vision and language alignment​ Image patch embeddings hold information in a representation space which is specific to the trained image encoder. Image encoders are usually trained on computer vision tasks, so they are not natively optimized for the job of providing useful information to a language model. So, how to ensure that the image encoder brings maximal useful information for text generation, for instance on various image-to-text tasks? First intuition to reduce the risk of misalignment (misunderstanding) between the image encoder and the language model is to choose the most appropriate image encoder. Almost all studied VLMs, except Pixtral 12B [6], rely on a “CLIP-like” image encoder. CLIP is a pair of image encoder and text encoder, which were jointly trained to embed any image and its caption (text) to very close representations in a same representation space. Therefore, we can consider that the image patch embeddings produced by CLIP image encoder contain almost the same information as would contain a good caption of the image. CLIP original paper [12] has inspired other scientific works based on the same image-text contrastive learning principle: we call them “CLIP-like”. With this training recipe, which “aligns” image representation and text representation, the image representation of CLIP-like models is expected to be more easily understood by a language model, or more easily convertible to text token embeddings. Second intuition is that the image representation must be adapted to tasks with vision during VLM training, not only in VLMs based on self-attention (where an adapter is required), but also in those based on cross-attention between text and image. This adaptation principle is generalized; yet, adaptation strategy is very different between papers. In some earlier works such as BLIP-2 [9] and MiniGPT-4 [11], a complex adapter (named “Q-Former”) is trained alone, during dedicated training steps (including on image-text matching and image-text contrastive training tasks), to convert the output of the image encoder into a new representation, fully optimized for text models. Other and more recent papers choose a simpler adapter, from a (still complex) Perceiver resampler in Flamingo [8], to a classical multi-layer perceptron in LLaVA-NeXT [1], CogVLM2 [2] and Pixtral 12B [6], or even a mere linear projection in LLaVA [1], LLaMA-Adapter [10] and PaliGemma [3]. As for LLama 3.2 [5], it relies on a different adaptation method: new trainable gated (i.e. inactivated before training) self-attention layers are inserted inside the image encoder, and progressively activated and trained during training on vision-language tasks. Train, train, and train again​ Okay ladies and gentlemen, we have solved the architecture questions: our language model is now fully connected to the trained image encoder. Now, how to fine-tune this vision-language model to ensure it can satisfy users on various image-text tasks, as if the language model had gained general vision abilities? Well, the solutions implemented in our reference papers are widely inspired from state-of-the-art language model training strategies. The principle is to design and implement a path of various training tasks, starting with the simpler ones, and then jumping to more complex jobs. More precisely, here are the most common or interesting supervised vision-language training tasks (or task families) for VLMs. Note that all of them just aim at improving next text token prediction: Image captioning: used for most VLMs, such as BLIP-2 [9], LLaMA-Adapter [10], LLaVA &amp; LLaVA-NeXT [1], CogVLM 1 &amp; 2 [2], PaliGemma [3], Phi-3-vision [4], LLama 3.2 [5]. Optical character recognition (OCR): used for CogVLM 1 &amp; 2 [2], PaliGemma [3], LLaVA-NeXT [1], Phi-3-vision [4], LLama 3.2 [5]. VQA i.e. visual question answering (answer questions regarding the provided image): used for BLIP-2 [9], LLaMA-Adapter [10], PaliGemma [3]. Various visual grounding tasks, in which the model learns to understand or generate references to positions inside an image, such as “grounded captioning”, “referring expression generation”, “referring expression comprehension”, “grounded VQA”... : used for CogVLM 1 &amp; 2 [2], PaliGemma [3], LLama 3.2 [5]. Reverse-engineering, to generate image source in HTML, Markdown or Latex : used for LLama 3.2 [5]. Next text token prediction on interleaved content (text interleaved with one or several images, e.g. simplified web pages): used for Flamingo [8], Phi-3-vision [4]. When several images are allowed, this can include training for in-context learning, which means that in training data, the text input (prompt or instruction) can include one or several examples of image paired with the expected answer, before inserting the image on which the model must answer. Multi-turn conversations (chat) with image input, including instruction following, image understanding, multi-turn VQA, OCR, reasoning...: used for LLaVA &amp; LLaVA-NeXT [1], CogVLM 1 &amp; 2 [2], Phi-3-vision [4], LLama 3.2 [5]. &quot;Safety&quot; training, i.e. train to generate best answer among multiple candidate answers, as selected by human labellers: used for Phi-3-vision [4]. Moreover, additional fine-tuning steps based on reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) can be added to increase (human) user satisfaction, for instance on VQA and chat with vision: this is applied for Phi-3-vision [4] and LLama 3.2 [5]. Available bimodal (paired text and image) training data is probably not as big and diverse as unimodal data (text only or image only), which may induce risks of overfitting during these bimodal training steps. Unfortunately, most papers studied here are not verbose on solutions against overfitting. Dropouts, weight decays seem commonly used and tuned; yet, Llava 1.5 [1] avoids weight decay. Image augmentation is studied but not generalized: for instance, BLIP-2 [9] benefits from random resized cropping and horizontal flipping, and Flamingo [8] adds color augmentation; but PaliGemma [3] just relies on label smoothing and dropout, without any data augmentation, which is proven to have no significant benefit. Llama-3.2 [5] goes further with a model soup: a &quot;hyperparameter sweep&quot; is run with multiple random data subsets and hyperparameter combinations, then the models are ranked, and finally, the weights of best models are averaged to obtain the final model. Freeze or don't freeze?​ We have understood that the most impressive VLMs, such as LLama 3.2 [5], have followed a quite long chain of training steps, with different task(s) at each step. We know that bimodal (vision-language) training steps follow the unimodal (language-only and vision-only) ones, that had previously been implemented to train the blind language model and the image encoder. But a question remains: how the ensure that during vision-language training, the VLM does not (catastrophically) forget what its two components (image encoder, language model) had correctly learnt? The answer is in the freezing strategy chosen for each model. Freezing the weights of both the image encoder and the language model, while training only the adapter and new layers added when building the VLM, is a secure way to avoid catastrophic forgetting, and to reduce risks of overfitting on images: it was adopted in earlier papers (Flamingo [8], LLaMA-Adapter [10], MiniGPT-4 [11]). However, total freezing probably reduces the ability of the VLM to maximize its performance on new vision-language tasks. Therefore, more recent works have experimented, with success, various unfreezing strategies. An intermediate strategy is to freeze the 2 initial models during the first vision-language training steps, and to unfreeze them (or one of the two) in the last training steps, as explained for BLIP-2 [9], LLaVA &amp; LLaVA-NeXT [1], CogVLM 1 &amp; 2 [2]. Some research teams go further: in LLama 3.2 [5], the image encoder is not frozen at all, whilst the language model is unfrozen after a few vision-language training steps. More impressively, PaliGemma [3] is trained without any freezing. Additionally, to preserve performance on text-only tasks, some papers explain that some vision-language training steps include language-only data, for instance CogVLM 2 [2] and Phi-3-vision [4]. Here is a simplified summary of the freezing strategies: Conclusion​ Vision language models, and more generally multimodal generative AI, are a very active field of research: we have lifted the hood of some foundational or recent scientific papers, with no claim to exhaustiveness. To sum up what we have observed in this article, we may remember that: An already trained language model can be “converted” to a vision language model (VLM) thanks to image encoder plugging and dedicated additional training steps, without significant decrease of its language abilities. Thus most VLMs defined in state-of-the-art papers are based on a previously trained blind (unimodal) language model, and rely on this “conversion” process. Plugging the image encoder may rely on cross-attention, or on self-attention with an adapter; there is currently no clear winner between these two alternative options. Simple deep learning layers can be applied to compensate initial misalignment between image representation and text representation. Rich and various training tasks (and of course, training data) are essential to get a performant VLM, and are presumably more important than architecture details. Most advanced recipes to build and train a VLM rely on progressive vision-language training (up to six steps) with progressive unfreezing of the language model.

Its enduring relevance stems from its ability to provide aggregate insights across channels without relying on individual-level tracking. In today's privacy-centric landscape, this advantage has become even more valuable. However, as marketing ecosystems grow increasingly complex, traditional MMM frameworks face new challenges in capturing the true dynamics of modern campaigns. This isn't to suggest that classical MMM approaches are obsolete—quite the contrary. Instead, we propose that integrating causal inference methodologies can enhance and extend these proven frameworks, addressing their limitations while preserving their strengths. The Causal Nature of Marketing ROI​ When any ad designer or CMO asks, &quot;What was the return on investment of our TV campaign?&quot;, they are not simply inquiring about correlation – they're asking a causal question. In statistical terms, they're seeking to measure the effect of TV advertising spend on sales. This is the so-called Average Treatment Effect (ATE) in the causal inference field of study. More specifically, they might want to understand this effect for: Specific time periods or conditionsWeeks or campaigns All of these questions are trying to explain the true incremental impact of marketing activities on business outcomes. Traditional MMM approaches typically employ regression techniques to model the relationship between marketing activities and business outcomes. These models have delivered substantial value by: Quantifying Channel Contributions: Estimating the impact of different marketing channels on sales or other KPIsOptimizing Budget Allocation: Providing guidance on how to distribute marketing investmentsForecasting Outcomes: Predicting the likely impact of planned marketing activities These capabilities remain valuable, and the established MMM ecosystem offers robust tools for addressing fundamental marketing measurement questions. However, classical approaches often make simplifying assumptions that can limit their accuracy in certain contexts. The Independence Assumption Bait​ While traditional regression models might seem sufficient when input variables are independent, real-world marketing data rarely satisfies this condition. Marketing plans are typically optimized to maximize sales, creating inherent correlations between channels and activities. This interdependence introduces several critical biases: Selection Bias: Advertisers naturally allocate more budget to channels that historically perform well, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy in the data.Temporal Confounding: Seasonal effects and marketing calendar events influence both advertising decisions and sales outcomes.Channel Interaction Effects: Marketing channels don't operate in isolation but influence and reinforce each other, creating complex causal pathways. Rather than replacing traditional MMM, causal inference methodologies can be integrated to address specific limitations while building upon the existing foundation. This integration helps solve several persistent challenges: Challenge 1: Confounding Variables​ Classical MMM struggles when unobserved factors influence both marketing decisions and outcomes. For example, a company might increase TV advertising during periods of expected high demand (holidays), making it difficult to disentangle the true impact of advertising from the seasonal effect. Causal inference explicitly models these confounding relationships: # Traditional approach might look like: import statsmodels.api as sm # Simplified regression model treating all variables as independent model = sm.OLS(sales, [tv_spend, digital_spend, search_spend, email_spend, seasonality]).fit() # Causal approach explicitly models the confounding structure: from dowhy import CausalModel import networkx as nx # Create a graph showing both direct effects and confounding relationships g = nx.DiGraph() # Add nodes for all variables g.add_nodes_from(['TV_Spend', 'Digital_Spend', 'Search_Spend', 'Email_Spend', 'Seasonality', 'Sales']) # Add direct effects on sales g.add_edges_from([ ('TV_Spend', 'Sales'), ('Digital_Spend', 'Sales'), ('Search_Spend', 'Sales'), ('Email_Spend', 'Sales') ]) # Add confounding relationships (seasonality affects both marketing and sales) g.add_edges_from([ ('Seasonality', 'TV_Spend'), ('Seasonality', 'Digital_Spend'), ('Seasonality', 'Sales') ]) # Add channel interaction effects (TV drives search behavior) g.add_edges_from([ ('TV_Spend', 'Search_Spend') ]) # Create causal model for a specific treatment (TV_Spend in this example) causal_model = CausalModel( data=df, treatment='TV_Spend', outcome='Sales', graph=g ) By explicitly modeling this causal structure, we can obtain unbiased estimates of the true effect of TV advertising, isolated from seasonal influences. Challenge 2: Channel Interactions and Spillover Effects​ Traditional models often treat marketing channels as independent contributors, but modern marketing ecosystems are characterized by complex interactions. TV advertising might boost search volume, social media campaigns might amplify email effectiveness, and so on. Causal modeling allows us to represent these dependencies mathematically: where represents the indirect effect of TV advertising on sales via its influence on search behavior. This captures the reality that when TV campaigns run, they often drive consumers to search for the product or brand online, creating an indirect pathway to conversion. By modeling these pathways explicitly, we can attribute effects more accurately and understand both direct and indirect impacts of each marketing channel. Challenge 3: Non-Random Media Allocation​ Marketing investments aren't randomly assigned—they're strategically allocated based on past performance, creating a form of selection bias. This can lead to misleading conclusions when using traditional regression approaches. The potential outcomes framework from causal inference helps address this by explicitly considering counterfactuals: where is the Average Treatment Effect Y(1) is the outcome with treatment, and Y(0) is the outcome without treatment. This framework forces us to consider what would have happened without a particular marketing intervention, providing a more accurate measure of true incremental impact. Moving Toward Causal Solutions​ To address these challenges at Ekimetrics, we've developed a hybrid approach that integrates causal inference into the classical MMM pipeline. By introducing a causal graph, we incorporate human expertise into the model, allowing us to explicitly represent and validate the relationships between variables. This step transforms MMM from a correlation-based tool into a causality-driven framework capable of uncovering adjusted marketing effectiveness. MMM Preprocessing​ Begin with established MMM preprocessing techniques: Adstock transformations to capture carryover effectsSaturation functions to model diminishing returnsSeasonality adjustments to account for cyclical patterns Building a Causal Graph​ Next, we build a causal graph that visualizes relationships between variables. Unlike traditional approaches, this step embeds domain expertise directly into the model. For instance, media_X might depend on media_Y, media_Z. Our causal graph explicitly encodes this dependency and establishes direct and indirect paths to the outcome variable. Validating Relationships​ Once the causal structure is in place, we validate it through a combination of rigorous methods to ensure robustness and credibility: Independence Tests We run statistical independence tests, such as the Chi-squared test, to verify whether the proposed relationships in the causal graph hold true in the data. These tests help confirm that the dependencies between variables are statistically significant and align with the causal structure. Overlap Testing When conditioning on specific variables (e.g., during causal discovery or effect estimation), it's crucial to ensure sufficient data points remain for robust analysis. We carefully assess data quantity and overlap to avoid issues of sparsity that could compromise the validity of the results. This step ensures that the model remains reliable even after stratifying or subsetting the data. Quantifying Causal Effects​ To understand the impact of each media campaign on sales, we use tools like DoWhy to estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) for each media variable. The ATE provides a quantitative measure of how much a given campaign influences sales, both directly and indirectly. # For each channel, identify proper adjustment variables identified_estimand = model.identify_effect(treatment='TV_Spend', outcome='Sales') # Estimate causal effect using a method that leverages traditional MMM strengths causal_estimate = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name=&quot;backdoor.linear_regression&quot;) This analysis also helps uncover synergies and spillover effects between variables, shedding light on how different campaigns interact with each other to drive outcomes. Ensuring Robustness​ Validation is a critical step in ensuring the reliability and practical utility of our causal model. Rather than simply accepting point estimates, we systematically quantify the uncertainty associated with our causal effect measurements—an approach that enhances both analytical rigor and decision-making transparency. We employ several complementary techniques to measure uncertainty: Confidence Intervals: Using bootstrapping approaches to generate confidence intervals around our Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimates. This provides stakeholders with a clear understanding of the range within which the true causal effect likely falls.Hypothesis Testing: Calculating p-values that indicate the statistical significance of identified effects, helping differentiate between genuine causal relationships and potential statistical noises.Sensitivity Analysis: Systematically varying model assumptions to understand how robust our causal estimates are to different specifications and data conditions. This focus on uncertainty measurement acknowledges the inherent limitations of causal inference in real-world settings with finite data. We recognize that causal estimates may be imperfect when data volume is limited, measurement noise is present, or when important variables might be unobserved. By transparently communicating these uncertainties, we enable more informed decision-making. We also reconcile the experiment's results with Business validation. This involves comparing your causal MMM results against actual experimental data to verify that your model's predictions match observed outcomes in controlled settings. This process serves as a reality check that bridges statistical models with empirical evidence. Conclusion​ As marketing ecosystems become increasingly complex, the need for robust causal inference in MMM grows more critical. By acknowledging and addressing the causal nature of marketing effectiveness measurement, we can deliver more accurate and actionable insights to decision-makers. Understanding MMM as a causal inference problem rather than just a regression task is crucial for modern marketing analytics. This perspective enables more accurate measurement of marketing effectiveness and better-informed decision-making in an increasingly complex digital landscape. Glossary​ Average Treatment Effect (ATE) The mean difference in outcomes between units that received a treatment and units that did not. In marketing, this represents the average incremental impact of a marketing intervention (e.g., TV campaign) on a business outcome (e.g., sales). Causal Discovery The process of learning causal relationships from observational data. This involves identifying which variables cause others and constructing a causal graph based on statistical patterns in the data, often combined with domain knowledge. Causal Graph A visual representation of causal relationships between variables using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). In marketing, causal graphs explicitly show how marketing channels influence each other and sales, as well as how external factors like seasonality affect both marketing decisions and outcomes. Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) A mathematical structure consisting of nodes (variables) and directed edges (causal relationships) with no cycles. DAGs provide a formal way to represent causal assumptions and identify proper adjustment sets for causal estimation. Confounding Variables Variables that influence both the treatment (e.g., marketing spend) and outcome (e.g., sales), potentially creating spurious associations. In marketing, seasonality is a common confounder as it affects both marketing decisions and consumer behavior. DoWhy An open-source Python library for causal inference that implements a four-step process: modeling, identification, estimation, and refutation. DoWhy provides tools to build causal graphs, identify proper estimation techniques, and validate causal assumptions. Overlap Testing A validation technique that ensures sufficient data exists across different values of treatment variables to enable robust causal estimation. This helps avoid extrapolation beyond the support of the data.","keywords":"Marketing Mix Modeling Causal inference Indirect effect Attribution modeling Marketing ROI causality Channel interaction effects Confounding variables marketing DoWhy Counterfactuals"},{"title":"Counterfactual Explanations: Enhancing Machine Learning Transparency and Delivering Actionable Insights","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"blog/Counterfactual_Explanations","content":"Counterfactual explanations are transforming how we interpret machine learning models by answering critical 'what-if' questions. Instead of simply revealing why a model made a particular decision, counterfactuals show how to change the outcome, bridging the gap between algorithmic decisions and human understanding. In this article, we explore what counterfactuals explanations are, why they matter, how they can be generated, and their future role in explainable AI (XAI). I. What is a Counterfactual Explanation in Machine Learning?​ Counterfactual explanations (or simply counterfactuals) describe how modifying specific input features could lead to a different model outcome. They provide minimal, actionable changes that would flip a prediction. They can be generated for both classification and regression problems. In the literature, the majority of studies have focused on classification problems, where counterfactuals suggest feature modifications to change a categorical outcome. Regression-based counterfactuals are now gaining more attention while facing specific issues related to continuous variable outcomes. Examples of Counterfactuals: Classification Example (Loan Approval): If a model predicts that a loan application is denied, a counterfactual might suggest that increasing the applicant’s income by $10,000 or reducing their existing debt by $5,000 could change the outcome to approved. Regression Example (House Price Prediction): If a model estimates a house's value at $300,000, a counterfactual might suggest that increasing the lot size by 500 square feet or adding an extra bedroom could raise the predicted price to $350,000. Unlike traditional interpretability techniques which highlight which features most influence a prediction, counterfactuals focus on how to change the outcome. Feature importance methods can be categorized into global and local approaches: global feature importance (e.g., Gini index) assesses the overall impact of each feature on the model across all predictions, while local feature importance (e.g., SHAP) explains the contribution of features to a specific instance’s prediction. Counterfactuals, in contrast, provide instance-specific insights by suggesting changes needed to obtain a different outcome. For example: Global feature importance tells us that income and credit score are the most important factors in a loan decision in general, not for a specific instance.SHAP quantifies how much each feature contributed to the final prediction.Counterfactuals go a step further by suggesting precise changes, such as increasing income by $10,000 to get the loan approved. This focus on actionability makes counterfactual explanations particularly valuable when users need clear next steps, rather than just a breakdown of feature contributions. II. Why Counterfactuals Matter in Machine Learning​ Counterfactual explanations can enhance AI transparency and fairness by addressing several key challenges: Actionable Insights​ As mentioned, unlike traditional explainability methods that only highlight influential features, counterfactuals provide clear, practical steps to achieve a desired outcome. Instead of just showing that income is important for loan approval, counterfactuals tell users exactly how much income needs to increase for approval. Trust and Compliance​ As AI systems play a growing role in decision-making, regulations require that automated decisions be explainable and fair. Counterfactuals help organizations justify decisions by demonstrating the exact changes that would have led to a different outcome. This improves: Transparency – Users understand why they received a particular decision.Fairness – Decision-making processes become more accountable.Trust – People are more likely to accept AI-driven outcomes if they can see how decisions are made. Model Debugging and Bias Detection​ Counterfactuals also help developers detect biases in machine learning models. For example, if certain demographic groups need unrealistically high increases in income to get loan approvals, this may indicate a hidden bias in the model. By analyzing these patterns, developers can: Identify fairness issuesRefine the model to reduce biasImprove model reliability and robustness By providing actionable recommendations, ensuring regulatory compliance, and improving model fairness, counterfactual explanations are essential for building trustworthy AI systems. III. Generating Counterfactuals: DiCE and MACE​ Counterfactual generation is a key step in understanding and improving machine learning models. Two widely used methods for generating counterfactuals are DiCE (Diverse Counterfactual Explanations) and MACE (Model-Agnostic Counterfactual Explanations with Constraints). DiCE (Diverse Counterfactual Explanations)​ DiCE, developed by Microsoft Research, is a powerful tool for generating diverse counterfactual explanations in machine learning. Unlike traditional counterfactual methods that focus on finding a single optimal explanation, DiCE emphasizes the importance of providing multiple, diverse alternatives. Key Features of DiCE:​ Model-Agnostic Approach: DiCE can work with any black-box model, making it versatile across different machine learning architectures.Diversity in Explanations: It generates a set of counterfactuals that are meaningfully different from each other, offering a broader perspective on possible changes.Customizable Constraints: Users can specify feature ranges and immutability, ensuring the generated counterfactuals are realistic and actionable.Multiple Generation Methods: DiCE employs various techniques including genetic algorithms, random sampling, and KD-tree search to efficiently explore the feature space.Scalability: It's designed to handle large datasets and complex models efficiently. DiCE solves a key limitation of single-counterfactual methods by offering multiple alternative solutions, which is especially useful when there are different ways to achieve the same outcome. This variety not only helps users explore more actionable options but also provides a clearer picture of the model’s decision boundaries. That said, while DiCE is a major step forward in explainable AI, it isn’t perfect without the right constraints, it can sometimes suggest unrealistic changes. That’s why domain expertise is essential for setting meaningful boundaries and making sense of the results. To better understand how DiCE works in practice, here is an example in Python demonstrating how to generate counterfactual explanations using a trained machine learning model: import dice_ml from dice_ml import Dice # Initialize a DiCE explainer with dataset details and model constraints d = dice_ml.Data(dataframe=X_train, continuous_features=numerical_features, outcome_name=target, permitted_range=permitted_ranges) # Wrap the trained model for use with DiCE m = dice_ml.Model(model=model, backend=&quot;sklearn&quot;) # Create a DiCE explainer instance exp = Dice(d, m) # Select a single test instance (excluding the target column) query_instance = X_test.drop(columns=[target]).iloc[0:1] # Generate counterfactual explanations for the selected instance counterfactuals = exp.generate_counterfactuals(query_instance, total_CFs=5, # Number of counterfactual examples to generate desired_class=&quot;opposite&quot;, # Flip the predicted class features_to_vary=actionable_features) # Features allowed to change # Display counterfactuals, showing only feature differences counterfactuals.visualize_as_dataframe(show_only_changes=True) MACE (Model-Agnostic Counterfactual Explanations with Constraints)​ MACE (Model-Agnostic Counterfactual Explanations) is an advanced approach to generating counterfactual explanations in machine learning, with a primary focus on ensuring the realism and feasibility of the generated explanations. Key features of MACE​ Constraint Integration: MACE incorporates domain-specific constraints directly into the counterfactual generation process. This ensures that all suggested changes are not only mathematically valid but also practically feasible and logically consistent.Model Agnosticism: Like other counterfactual methods, MACE can work with any type of machine learning model, making it versatile across different applications and model architectures.Plausibility Enforcement: MACE prevents the generation of impossible or unrealistic counterfactuals. For instance, it won't suggest changes like reducing age or altering immutable characteristics.Customizable Rules: Users can define specific constraints tailored to their domain, allowing for fine-grained control over what types of changes are considered acceptable.Handling Complex Data Types: MACE is designed to work effectively with both numerical and categorical features, addressing the challenges posed by mixed data types in real-world datasets. MACE stands out for its ability to generate realistic and actionable explanations. However, this realism comes at a cost. MACE is more computationally intensive than simpler counterfactual methods because it solves complex optimization problems with constraints. Despite this, MACE has proven highly valuable in situations where explanation credibility and regulatory compliance matter most. That said, the quality of MACE’s explanations still depends on well-defined constraints and high-quality data. Without these, even the most advanced counterfactual method can produce misleading or unhelpful results. To better understand how MACE works in practice, here is an example in Python demonstrating how to generate counterfactual explanations using a trained machine learning model: from omnixai.data.tabular import Tabular from omnixai.preprocessing.tabular import TabularTransform from omnixai.explainers.tabular import MACEExplainer # Load the dataset into an OmnixAI Tabular object tabular_data = Tabular(df, feature_columns=feature_names, # List of feature column names categorical_columns=categorical_features, # Specify categorical features target_column=target # Specify the target variable ) # Fit a tabular transformer for preprocessing (e.g., encoding, scaling) transformer = TabularTransform().fit(tabular_data) class_names = transformer.class_names # Get class labels from the transformer # Define a prediction function that applies the model after transformation predict_function = lambda z: model.predict_proba(transformer.transform(z)) # Initialize the MACE counterfactual explainer maceexplainer = MACEExplainer( training_data=tabular_data, # Provide the training dataset predict_function=predict_function, # Use the defined prediction function ignored_features=features_to_ignore # Specify features that should not be modified ) # Select test instances (excluding the target column) for explanation test_instances = tabular_data.remove_target_column()[0:5] # Generate counterfactual explanations for the selected test instances explanations = maceexplainer.explain(test_instances) # Visualize the counterfactual explanation for the first test instance explanations.ipython_plot(index=0, class_names=class_names) Example of MACE Application to the Give Me Some Credit Dataset​ To demonstrate how MACE can be used in a real-world setting, we applied it to the well-known Give Me Some Credit dataset from Kaggle. This dataset was originally used in a 2011 competition to predict the likelihood of a borrower becoming seriously delinquent (90+ days late on a payment) within two years. Dataset Overview​ The dataset includes over 250,000 anonymized credit records, split into 150,000 training examples and 101,503 test instances. The target variable is SeriousDlqin2yrs (1 = default, 0 = no default), and each record contains 10 explanatory variables that capture an individual’s credit behavior, income, and financial obligations. Key features include: RevolvingUtilizationOfUnsecuredLines: Utilization ratio of unsecured lines (e.g., credit cards)DebtRatio: Proportion of debt relative to incomeMonthlyIncome: Self-reported monthly incomeNumberOfOpenCreditLinesAndLoans: Total number of credit lines and loansNumberOfTimes90DaysLate: Frequency of severe delinquency Model Training​ For this case study, we used XGBoost, a gradient boosting algorithm known for its ability to handle structured data and capture nonlinear relationships. XGBoost was trained on the preprocessed training data to predict the likelihood of loan default (SeriousDlqin2yrs). After training, we applied MACE to generate counterfactual explanations for individuals predicted as high risk (i.e., default = 1). The goal was to understand what minimal and realistic changes could flip their classification to non-default. Two counterfactuals were generated for the individual originally predicted to default (label = 1). The original instance had a DebtRatio of 0.803 and a MonthlyIncome of 9120.0. The first counterfactual (CF 1) keeps the DebtRatio constant at 0.803 but increases the MonthlyIncome to 9422.625, resulting in a predicted label of 0 (non-default). The second counterfactual (CF 2) achieves the same label flip by simultaneously lowering the DebtRatio to 0.7993 and raising the MonthlyIncome to 9422.625. This demonstrates that modest, realistic adjustments to financial metrics can alter risk classification, highlighting specific and actionable paths to improve creditworthiness. IV. The Future of Counterfactuals and Explainable AI​ Counterfactual explanations are becoming an increasingly important tool for AI transparency and decision-making. As the field evolves, several key trends are shaping their future. One major shift is the integration of causal reasoning into counterfactual methods. Instead of simply answering &quot;what-if&quot; questions, future approaches will identify real cause-and-effect relationships, helping distinguish meaningful factors from random correlations. This will make counterfactual explanations more reliable and actionable. Another important development is the move toward automated constraints. Rather than relying on manually defined rules, new techniques will learn realistic constraints directly from data. This will ensure that counterfactual suggestions remain practical and achievable without requiring extensive human oversight. Despite these advancements, challenges remain especially in scaling counterfactual methods for complex models like transformers and ensuring they work effectively across different languages and cultures. To address these issues, we have been developing a counterfactual generator that prioritizes plausibility and proximity. By ensuring that suggested changes are both realistic and within the distribution, our approach aims to provide users with more trustworthy insights into AI-driven decisions. Counterfactuals are playing a key role in shifting AI from an opaque &quot;black box&quot; to a transparent, user-friendly system. By making machine learning more explainable, accountable, and actionable, they will help shape the future of ethical and trustworthy AI.","keywords":"XAI Explainability Interpretability Machine learning Data science Deep learning Innovation Transparency AI Model optimisation Fairness  Actionability Code"},{"title":"ClimateQ&A","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"blog/ClimateQ&A","content":"","keywords":"Climate  biodiversity Generative AI GenAI IPCC IPBES OCR AIforgood Climate Science Sustainability transition AI"},{"title":"I.

Across geographies, widespread climate literacy remains low, which limits and hinders actions to mitigate and adapt to these pressing challenges. This lack of actionable knowledge is due to several factors, including the increasing demand for climate-related information from all groups of society (including the public sector, students, corporates, policymakers, investors, and local communities, among many others), and rising fake news &amp; climate skepticism. Another important issue is that scientific reports of IPCC and IPBES present some inherent limitations regarding accessibility, language, and understanding. Indeed, at a Side Event at COP21 in Paris, in the lead-up to the Oslo Expert Meeting on Communication in 2016, IPCC Chair Hoseung Lee asked : “What use are the IPCC reports if many of the intended users cannot understand them, do not know where to find them, or cannot use them in their work?” In this part we explore these issues, which are vital to inform the development of our tool ClimateQ&amp;A.

Literacy on climate change is vital for informed decision-making, emissions reduction, and community resilience.&quot; 1 Despite the importance of climate literacy, studies find that in advanced economies, ~70% of people are aware of climate change and its consequences, but only 20% are climate-literate2 3. Additionally, climate awareness is unequally distributed: in 2015, 40% of adults in the world had never heard of climate change – roughly 2Bn people. In some developing countries like Egypt, Bangladesh, or India, this represents more than 65% of the adult population4.  "},{"title":"B. The demand for climate-related information is increasing​","type":1,"pageTitle":"ClimateQ&A","url":"blog/ClimateQ&A#bthe-demand-for-climate-related-information-is-increasing","content":"Driven by the global and far-reaching implications of climate change - across geographies, populations, sectors of activity, organizations- the demand for accurate, timely, and relevant climate information is increasing. Businesses and investors seek to understand their exposure to climate and biodiversity-related risks. Educators need to train a new generation of students, who will live with the consequences of climate change. Policymakers require reliable information for effective strategies. The media plays a vital role in disseminating factual information to the general public. As climate change shapes our world, this demand will continue to grow, requiring informed decision-making across sectors. Another significant catalyst for information demand stems from the targeting of the IPCC by misinformation campaigns. The surge in media coverage surrounding climate change has witnessed a simultaneous surge in influential campaigns disseminating misinformation. These campaigns employ tactics such as selective media exposure, contrived controversies, alternative facts, and distorted media balance. Adding to this, social media algorithms amplify existing social circles and reinforce pre-existing opinions, while individuals increasingly rely on these platforms as their primary sources of information. Consequently, people find themselves trapped in echo chambers, unaware of the consensus or under the false impression that substantial uncertainty exists5. Frequently, socio-economic narratives and a sense of loss resulting from climate change policies direct individuals toward disbelief and denial. These narratives create a clash between scientific communications on climate change and one's familiar ideas and way of life, often intertwined with automobiles, industry, consumption, and a carbon-centric economy. As climate skepticism is based on narratives that do not even revolve around climate itself6, climate science communications have often achieved limited success. In this context, it becomes paramount for climate scientists to multiply their communication endeavors and generate tailored content that caters to diverse audiences. By doing so, they would ensure that each segment of society has access to information that is relevant to their specific needs and concerns. This would enable users to not only access the desired information but also empower them to fact-check the information they come across. While the IPCC has made significant efforts to improve its communication strategy (e.g.; the organization held The Expert Meeting on Communication of 2016 which led to a number of recommendations to enhance IPCC communications activities, strategy and capacity), there are a number of limitations to this strategy stemming from how these organizations operate.  "},{"title":"C. The role of the IPCC and IPBES : practical limitations and consequences​","type":1,"pageTitle":"ClimateQ&A","url":"blog/ClimateQ&A#cthe-role-of-the-ipcc-and-ipbes--practical-limitations-and-consequences","content":"IPCC and IPBES reports are the Gold Standard of the science of climate and nature, as they present a scientific consensus and synthetize in great detail, coverage, and historical depth the key considerations regarding living and countering with climate change, and the trends of biodiversity and nature’s contribution to people. Despite the unquestionable thoroughness and quality of these assessments, challenges to their true adoption by policymakers and civil society persist. Some practical challenges include: Language. One significant limitation is the language barrier. Due to their affiliation with the United Nations, the IPCC and IPBES reports are only available in the UN's official languages, namely Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian, Spanish, and English. While these languages are spoken by approximately four billion people as either a first or second language, which accounts for 50% of the global population, the remaining 50% are unable to access climate science information from official sources due to this language restriction. Audience. Another challenge lies in the intended audience of these reports. Originally designed to provide a comprehensive review and recommendations on the state of climate science, the main recipients of these reports are technical audiences, such as scientists and policymakers. The IPCC and IPBES produce various types of documents, including Summary for Policymakers (SPMs), Full Reports, and Technical Summaries. These reports are often lengthy, exceeding 15,000 pages for the main IPCC and IPBES reports, and are filled with specialized terminology, such as confidence levels and uncertainty. Additionally, these reports are accessible only in PDF format through the respective organizations' websites. The level of complexity of this publications is such that at the 5th Assessment Report, senior policymakers called for a “Summary for Citizens” to complement the Summary for Policymakers7. Moreover, as the organizations' mandates emphasize neutrality and a &quot;policy-relevant&quot; but not &quot;policy-prescriptive&quot; approach, their ability to communicate and engage with stakeholders is limited. They are constrained from publishing any information that has not undergone rigorous multilateral validation or that lacks contextualization. With the general purpose of bridging climate and nature science to policymaking, both organizations are built on three emergent principles: holding the line between policy relevance and prescription, enlisting geographically diverse participants, and evolving a thicket of procedures to guard scientific credibility8. The first principle aims to provide policy-relevant information without prescribing specific policies9, thus upholding neutrality and respecting the mandates of multilateral environmental agreements10. In an official statement, the IPCC declares : “By endorsing the IPCC reports, governments acknowledge the authority of their specific content. The work of the organization is therefore policy-relevant and yet policy-neutral, never policy-prescriptive11.” What this means, is that in order to publish approved, adopted, and accepted reports, these organizations avoid technocratically mandating a particular policy solution when a range of options are feasible (even to different degrees)12. While this neutrality reinforces the credibility that is derived from their strict processes, it gives rise to two major improvement areas: The need to consider reports collectively13. To avoid missing important information, it is essential to consider the entire body of reports collectively. The IPCC reports undergo a formal review process involving multiple drafts. Comments and feedback are provided by scientific experts, as well as representatives from governments and appointed consultants. These comments are taken into account during the approval of the Summary for Policymakers (SPM) and acceptance of the full report. Given that SPMs are subject to a high degree of compression, each sentence requires approval from the parties involved (scientists and government representatives), which often leads to rigorous discussions14. While this dialogue-based approach strengthens the IPCC assessment, it is important to make other relevant documents accessible to interested audiences. That scientific knowledge must be accessible to non-technical audiences. Building upon the previous point, the strict rules governing report texts restrict their modification. The IPCC faces challenges in presenting reports to non-specialists in a language that is more accessible, avoiding jargon such as confidence levels and likelihood language15, as well as reducing their length. While the IPCC may face criticism for delivering messages in a clearer, shorter, and potentially less rigorous manner, collaboration with other stakeholders can help bridge this gap.

The document structure is preserved, meaning that paragraphs are linked to section titles, figures are linked to the passages that cite them, etc. A structured database is thus created, containing all the information extracted from the documents and the relationships between the different entries in the database. These entries are then represented as a vector of finite dimension. In ClimateGPT, we use SentenceBert, but any type of representation is possible. This will serve as the basis for a quick search in the database for step 3. Step 2: Enrichment of the user's LLM query In the second step, the user's query is reformulated and enriched by searching for similar passages in the structured database. The relevant question and passages are encapsulated in a prompt, which also serves to limit the scope of acceptable answers for ClimateQ&amp;A. Within the step of enriching the user's query, the goal is to create a query on an LLM from the question, whose answer will be formulated from the documents of interest (the structured database from step 1). First, the user's question is reformulated in a more intelligible way for a LLM by asking the model to do it. Then, the new question is compared to all entries in the database using the Faiss algorithm developed by Facebook, known for its execution speed on data corpora up to billions of entries. The most relevant entries, meaning those with the most significant similarity to the question, are selected, filtered by a thematic classification model (in this case, does the entry discuss climate?) and encapsulated in a prompt, necessary for querying an LLM (in our case, GPT-3.5 Turbo). The prompt contains other information, such as not going beyond the scope of its knowledge and formulating its answer based on the selected entries. The prompt created is then used to query an LLM. Step 3: Displaying the results : generative part The query result (i.e.; the question) is displayed on an interface. The answer is generated using the 10 most relevant references found in the corpus of documents. The sources are displayed alongside the answer, so that the user can verify the information and extract it for a report if necessary. The display is based on two parts: the LLM's answer with the notes serving as a reference, as well as the sources used to formulate the answer. For ClimateQ&amp;A, we use the OpenAI Azure environment to send the request and get the response. Just like the ClimateQ&amp;A interface, the user can continue their search by asking several questions in a row like a real ChatBot. Comments and future work We use GPT-3.5 Turbo for Climate Q&amp;A, but our methodology can be applied to any type of LLM. We have chosen this tool for the generative part of our model because it has been exceptionally optimized for dialogue using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) – a method that uses human demonstrations and preference comparisons to guide the model towards desired behaviors. In the future we will test other models like Bard and Llama. The hierarchy of the documents are not taken into account in the first version. Summary reports can be used in a first time to a concise answer. If the user wants more details, global and longer reports can then served as references to add additional facts, numbers to the answer. Looking for passages or references in the most recent documents could also make our approach more relevant. This feature will be added in the next version of Climate Q&amp;A. Qdrant is an excellent alternative to FAISS algorithm for search similarity, as it allows natively metadata featuring ( e.g. : search for a specific set of documents, or creating filters on passages), whereas FAISS can not. Moreover, Qdrant is faster for a small amount of data and is easier to use and maintain in production. We will add Qdrant as an option of similarity search for our next version. The interface of the first version of Climate Q&amp;A displays textual information only. In the future, we will integrate images and graphics to enrich the answer. Building a specific graph for the answer would also be a notable improvement. For example, a graph which shows the evolution of the carbon footprint for a country per year is of a great interest to the question : “Did the carbon footprint of France increase the last five years?” Textual data is now the main source of references for Climate Q&amp;A, but a lot of information is contained in tabs or graphics (like checked numbers etc). One of the main improvements for Climate Q&amp;A is to better parse and retrieve information from graphics and tabs. It will include novels features in OCR techniques and information retrieval techniques.  "},{"title":"IV. Algorithm performance​","type":1,"pageTitle":"ClimateQ&A","url":"blog/ClimateQ&A#ivalgorithm-performance","content":"In order to assess the performance of our model, we evaluate the individual performances of each of the elements that form the generation of an answer. Retrieval: evaluating the retrieval process specifically on our data is a difficult task without a custom labialized dataset. Our approach to quantitatively evaluate it was to sample a thousand paragraphs from our knowledge base, and for each ask a LLM to generate a question that could be answered with each paragraph. Then, we did the inverse process and tried retrieving the documents using the questions. For the model we currently use, the paragraph was in the top 10 documents retrieved in 3 cases out of 4. There are lots of biases to this method and we are still working to refine it, but the results allow us to test and compare performance for different retrieval models. Generation: answers provided by ClimateQ&amp;A are subject to a human evaluation whose evaluation criteria are outlined below. We analyse the performance of our model by comparing the answers of ChatGPT and ClimateQ&amp;A to those provided by the IPCC, assumed to be a “ground of truth”. We evaluate the answers based on the below criteria, i.e. relevance, accuracy and completeness, structure, quoting, and consistency. These serve as a qualitative measure of performance for the algorithm.  "},{"title":"V. Limitations​","type":1,"pageTitle":"ClimateQ&A","url":"blog/ClimateQ&A#vlimitations","content":"ClimateQ&amp;A has been built to answer to climate and biodiversity-related questions by finding 10 relevant paragraphs in the original IPCC and IPBES documents and generating an answer from those paragraphs. There are inherent limitations to this configuration and the underlying assets and tools that we use to parse the documents, retrieve relevant sources, and generate answers. In this part, we elaborate on these limitations, which we are planning to address in the following versions of the tool. These limitations are related to the content of the answers, biases inherent to the configuration of the model and the generative module, and the environmental footprint of AI. Limitations regarding the answers : ClimateQ&amp;A performs well in questions that are somewhat specific and whose answers can be found in the reports. ClimateQ&amp;A does not work well when it comes to summarizing entire documents. For example, a question such as “What are the conclusions of the last IPCC report on climate mitigation?” will not yield a high quality answer. The questions need to be more precise and concise in order for the retriever to find relevant passages and produce a better answer.ClimateQ&amp;A cannot directly answer questions whose answers cannot be found in the reports, but that are relevant to understand and fight against global warming in specific contexts, for example “What is the IPCC’s position on the use of megadams as a solution to climate change?”, “Which French political party has the strongest measures against climate change?”, etc. These questions might not be answered precisely and could even be blocked by our moderation feature.For other limitations of GPT-3 models regarding text synthesis and structural &amp; algorithmic limitations, please refer to (Brown, et al. 2020). Bias: there are some bias associated to how the model is built and the underlying assets. Bias from the generation of answers linked to ChatGPT: GPT-3 was trained on a massive dataset of text from the open internet, including the entire public internet toughly every month since its inception (60% of weight in training mix, also called CommonCrawl), a crowd-sourced curated selection of the internet most popular page referrals from Reddit and Social Media (with a weight of 22%, also called the WebText2 dataset), portions of books that are available online (16%), and Wikipedia in English (3%). Though sources are diverse, the biases of the data that the model has been trained on are retained. Biases favor language &amp; culture (predominantly English and Western-centric) and men. Conversely, negative sentiments are recorded for black people and Islam in GPT-316. These biases represent an important aspect to assess the broader societal impacts of tools like ClimateQ&amp;A, especially as those biases translate in prejudices and views about climate change, which are, as seen in Part 1, very context-specific. In general, we find that the Anglo-Saxon single-materiality approach, i.e. to consider climate change risks that might have a financial impact on businesses (and not also the impacts of businesses on climate change), might produce some biases in our model. ChatGPT has also been finetuned via human feedback and user feedback. These might represent additional biases to the model. Bias in structure and selection : The developers of ClimateQ&amp;A are European data scientists, engineers and climate / biodiversity consultants. There may be some biases related to the background of these persons, as well as the fact that none are climate or biodiversity scientists. While we have received feedback from expert scientists, most users that have given feedback are non-technical regarding climate change. These might influence how the model is built and the answers that are generated. Positive bias in the questions that are asked to the algorithm: we have introduced a positive bias in the questions asked to the model by providing a reformulation feature that softens the contents of the answers. For example, questions that read “Should we eat the rich?” were reformulated as “What are the most effective ways to reduce the carbon footprint of the wealthiest people in society?”. Limitations regarding the environmental impact of AI: training and using large AI models requires substantial amounts of resources. The progress driving large models has been achieved through increasingly large and computationally-intensive deep learning models and in general, improving accuracy of models is at the expense of economic, environmental, and social costs17. In order to evaluate the environmental impact of our model, we need indicators that measure the environmental impact of each module (given that we don’t train the model ourselves), and that can be aggregated for total. As the environmental impacts of AI depend on the local energy infrastructure, hardware used, running time, and the number of parameters, there are still few measures available to perform this task and inform users. Carbon footprint: to estimate the carbon footprint of our model, we use CodeCarbon, a Python package that estimates the power consumption of hardware (GPU, CPU and RAM) and applies the carbon intensity of the region where the computing is done18. We estimate the following emissions for each phase of the project at Ekimetrics. *Link for The carbon footprint of ChatGPT Carbon Emissions are relatively low but not negligible compared to other usages: one question asked to ClimateQ&amp;A is around 0.482gCO2e - equivalent to 2.2m by car and 1ml of water19. In this calculation we do not include the carbon footprint of training ChatGPT (done by OpenAI) that has been estimated to 1,287MWh, corresponding to 552 tons of CO2 equivalent, which is similar to 1.2M liters of water and 2.5M km by car, 63x the Earth’s circumference. These calculations are estimates and should be considered carefully20.

In a world where ecological transition has become imperative, no sector can escape scrutiny of its environmental impact - and communication is no exception, being directly and indirectly responsible for 5% of French emissions. Our research, of which we present the first part here, aims to break down and analyze the carbon footprint of the communication industry. This analysis is structured around two complementary publications: In this first article, we establish the conceptual foundations necessary to understand the complexity of the sector's environmental impact. We explore the crucial distinction between direct and indirect effects, before delving into the various mechanisms through which communication influences our consumption behaviors. This theoretical framework is essential for grasping the true environmental challenges facing the sector. The second part will focus on precisely quantifying these impacts through a rigorous methodology. We will reveal data on the carbon impact of communication in France, showing orders of magnitude that could transform our perception of this sector's role in the climate crisis. Together, these two articles offer a holistic understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing the communication industry considering the climate emergency. Because while understanding is the first step, precise measurement is the essential prerequisite for any effective action. A Dual Impact​ The environmental impact of communication breaks down into two main effects, fundamentally different in their nature and scale: Direct emissions: linked to the consumption and purchases necessary for the creation and distribution of communications. These correspond, for example, to the pollution generated by powering advertising servers and printing posters.Indirect emissions: resulting from changes in consumption and behaviors caused by these communications. Advertising contributes to expanding market sizes, and consequently the production of polluting goods. Figure 1 : Breakdown of marketing impact (Ekimetrics, 2023) This distinction is key to properly understanding the environmental responsibility of the sector. Let's examine each of these dimensions in more detail. However, be careful, the notion of scope 4 is often used to refer to these indirect emissions. This doesn't make sense because indirect emissions are related to emissions that the company records in its scopes 1, 2, and 3 to produce the goods and services sold thanks to marketing. However, these emissions could have been avoided if marketing had promoted other less emissive products or not promoted products at all. Figure 2 : Contribution of direct and indirect impact to a company's carbon footprint Let's look at each of these elements in more detail: Direct Impact: A Highly Structured Area in France with Ongoing Internationalization​ Unlike the indirect impact, still largely unexplored, the direct impact of communication benefits from growing attention and significant standardization efforts in methodology to quantify environmental impacts. These efforts focus on establishing consistent measurement frameworks and assessment protocols across the industry. French Professionalization of Measurement​ France is at the forefront of this structuring, with an ecosystem of specialized tools according to communication sectors. It's interesting to distinguish between work done to evaluate emissions due to production and those related to message distribution: Production: France Conditions its Aid on Environmental Assessment​ In the field of audiovisual production, several calculators have been approved by the National Center for Cinema (CNC): SeCO2 developed by Secoya Eco-tournage, allowing measurement of the footprint of live-action productions.Carbon' Clap created by the Ecoprod association, a pioneer in this field.Carbon Stage designed by the company Greenly. The animation sector is also well represented with Carbulator, developed by Anim France, while the video game industry has Jyros, created by Game Only. This structuring is accompanied by progressive institutionalization: the CNC now conditions certain subsidies on conducting environmental impact analyses, strongly encouraging the adoption of these practices. Distribution: Towards Standardization of Methods​ On the communication distribution side, professional unions and audience measurers such as SRI or SNPTV are developing calculators to homogenize data collection and impact analysis. Among advertisers, the Union Des Marques (UDM) is taking a step back and proposing to aggregate these initiatives in a meta-framework intended to harmonize and make visible all these tools (Press: SEPM, Digital: SRI, Radio: Bureau de la Radio, TV: SNPTV, outdoor: UPE) An Internationalizing Dynamic​ This French movement is rapidly extending internationally. The multiplication of specialized third parties measuring environmental footprint (Scope 3, I-Care, DK, ALICE developed by Publicis, Ekimetrics) has led to the birth of a global initiative: Add Net Zero. This coalition aims to harmonize methodologies and create a global standard for the communication industry. Digital giants are also beginning to integrate these concerns. For example, Google now publishes information on the carbon footprint of its advertising campaigns. A Persistent Blind Spot​ Despite these significant advances, a fundamental dimension remains absent from current frameworks: the impact of the message conveyed. Existing tools focus exclusively on production and distribution processes, neglecting the effect of content on consumption behaviors. This gap is problematic because our conceptual analysis suggests that this indirect impact could far exceed that of direct operations. Precisely measuring the carbon footprint of a filming or the energy consumption of a digital campaign is necessary but insufficient to understand the overall environmental responsibility of the sector. That's why we want to address it as an equally important subject to indirect impact. Indirect Effect: The Hidden Power of Communication on Our Consumption Choices​ The indirect impact of communication represents a complex ecosystem of intertwined influences on our consumption behaviors. Far from being monolithic, this impact unfolds through several distinct mechanisms, forming a web of influences with varied environmental consequences. The Triptych of Advertising Impact​ Our analysis of scientific literature has allowed us to identify three fundamental mechanisms through which communication modifies consumption behaviors: The (adverse) redistribution effect postulates that the market is a zero-sum game and that advertising changes the distribution of demand among brands. When a car brand communicates effectively, it can attract 100 customers who would otherwise have bought from a competitor, without increasing the total number of vehicles sold (Dubois et al., 2018). It's a transfer of market share without modification of the overall volume of sales. The growth effect represents the ability of communication to extend the boundaries of the market itself. A campaign for smartphones can convince consumers who had not planned to buy a new device this year to take the plunge, thus creating additional demand that would not have existed without this communication. The price effect, particularly subtle, leads advertising to transform the perception of value and price sensitivity (Erdem et al., 2008). Premium communication for organic coffee can simultaneously justify a higher price for certain consumers (potentially decreasing the volume sold) while drawing attention to the entire category, stimulating price sensitivity and sometimes pushing competitors' prices downward (thus increasing the overall volume). Radically Different Environmental Consequences​ These three effects are compatible with brands' objective of maximizing profitability. However, they fundamentally diverge in their environmental implications: The redistribution effect, although seemingly neutral since it does not modify the overall volume of consumption, can nevertheless lead to significant indirect consequences. If an SUV manufacturer captures market share at the expense of a manufacturer of low-consumption city cars, the overall carbon impact increases without any additional cars being sold. This effect reveals the ability of communication to redirect consumption flows between products with different carbon footprints. The growth effect constitutes the most directly problematic mechanism from an environmental perspective. Each additional act of consumption represents a new drain on planetary resources and new greenhouse gas emissions. The effectiveness of communication in generating additional demand then becomes a direct amplifier of environmental pressure. The price effect presents a fundamental ambivalence. On one hand, communication can help valorize sustainable products, justifying a price premium that finances ecological innovation. On the other hand, by making consumers less sensitive to price, it can democratize access to certain high-impact product categories, increasing their diffusion. The directionality of this effect fundamentally depends on the nature of the products promoted. Towards an Operational Analytical Framework​ To establish a rigorous conceptual framework for the indirect impact of communication, we must recognize these nuances while keeping in mind the objective of a practical assessment. The redistribution effect, although important for understanding market dynamics, presents an apparent neutrality that can be misleading when applied to products with different environmental footprints. The price effect, meanwhile, would require detailed econometric data to be properly evaluated. This complexity reminds us that any measure of the environmental impact of communication must integrate not only the volume of consumption generated, but also the nature of the products and services promoted, as well as their alternatives in the market. In the second part of our article, we try to quantify the Impact of Communication on Our Carbon Footprint Conclusion​ At the end of this analysis, one observation stands out: the iceberg of the environmental impact of communication shows only its tip. With only 6% direct impact against 94% indirect impact, we must fundamentally rethink our approach to the sector. In our next article, we will dive into the precise figures and methodologies that allow us to quantify this impact, revealing how communication could become a major lever for ecological transition rather than an accelerator of unsustainable consumption. The question that awaits us is crucial: how to transform a sector whose historical purpose has been to stimulate consumption into a catalyst for sobriety? Works Cited​ Arcom. (2024).

Search engines, video-sharing platforms, social media and now streaming services: ads are present in many formats on the Internet. In fact, most online platforms are partially or totally financed by advertising. Ad spending by brands subsidies online services, allowing platforms to charge no price to users. This is not new: classified ads financed free newspapers, just as brand sponsoring subsidized radio broadcast. So, what’s new with online advertising? Economists pointed out that online advertising decreased the cost of targeting consumers2. This is a major change in the marketing industry. While offline, advertisers can only target their ads toward a general context (newspaper title, TV show, billboard location), online ads can be addressed on a consumer-level basis using personal data (socio-demographics, web history, online behaviors). This decrease in targeting cost acted as a game-changer on many parts of the advertising industry: Pricing and auctions: finer targeting increases the quantity of ad impressions available to advertisers. As a result, such a massive volume of impressions cannot be sold at a flat price, just as in the offline advertising world. On the Internet, ad impressions are thus often allocated by auctions. Advertisers compete for a given ad impression based on the characteristics of the impression (user data, website…). The brand associated with the higher bid then wins the impression and displays its ad. This allows ad spaces to be priced at their right price, making advertisers and publishers better off. Intermediaries: this complex system of auctions induces that brands and publishers should be able to manage their ad opportunities and bidding strategy on an impression-per-impression basis. Naturally, given the high volume of ad impressions traded every minute, this is not feasible. That is why, online, many ad intermediaries manage the trading of ad spaces on the supply-side (publishers) as well as on the demand-side (advertisers). Data and Measurement: the technical nature of online advertising emphasizes the power of data. Views, clicks, conversions: low-targeting costs allow advertisers to observe individual responses to their ads, producing a huge amount of data. Machine learning and data analysis are used at every stage of the ad-serving to optimize advertisers’ bid, click-through-rate, publisher revenues, post-campaign attribution… That is why observers often made the claim that with the Internet, the advertising industry went from Mad Men to Maths Men. This PhD thesis focuses on two questions: (i) how online advertising is distinct from traditional advertisement and (ii) how context plays a role in online ads effectiveness. These questions are answered using econometric techniques applied to advertising data. "},{"title":"Old World, New World?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Maths Men: The Economics of Online Advertising","url":"blog/Economics_online_ad#old-world-new-world","content":"The first part of the thesis studies whether online advertising is a complement or a substitute to traditional advertisements (the one defined by offline mediums such as TV, radio, billboards, newspapers, or cinema). As we saw in the introduction, online advertising works in a very different way compared to offline media where ad buying involves human negotiation, discounts and where ad effectiveness cannot be observed directly. However, many economists claimed that offline and online advertising were close substitutes3. One can investigate this question according to two viewpoints: advertising supply and demand. On the supply-side, we can determine that two types of advertising media are substitutes if brands tend to use both interchangeably. Conversely, two advertising media types are complements when advertisers tend to use them together, with the goal of generating synergies. Substitutability between two media types can be investigated using the concept of cross-price elasticity: when the price of a media type increases, how does it impact the demand for another media type? Using data from 10 big national advertisers in three different industries, I investigate how firm’s spending on offline, internet display4 and search ads react to each media price. Using an econometric model derived from microeconomic theory, I find that offline and online advertising media types are not close substitutes. Intuitively, offline and search do not substitute for each other. Display and offline ad media types seem to be substitutes, but mostly for non-audiovisual media such as newspapers, magazines, and billboards. Indeed, internet display formats substitutes more easily to print advertisement than to TV or radio ads. Finally, the model shows that display and search ads are substitutable for advertisers. This can be natural as it seems certain types of display ads (such as retargeting) can be used to generate conversions, just as search ads. We can also determine whether offline and online ads are complements or substitutes by looking at the demand side: i.e., how consumers respond to ads. Marketing researchers showed that advertising campaigns on different media may generate synergies5. That is, the return of investing on two media may be greater than the sum of the two returns taken individually. This kind of synergy typically happens when branding and conversion media are played together. For example, a national TV campaign may raise awareness and desirability for a product, increasing online search volume and thus the effectiveness of sponsored links. In another study of the thesis, I try to draw a line between offline ad spending and the effectiveness of search ads. Using data from a panel of brands in the hotel sector, I build an econometric model where clicks on sponsored search ads depend on the brand’s own offline ad spending, other ad spending, seasonality, search ad exposure and market-specific factors. Because the effect of offline ad campaigns may be inter-temporal, the investments of period t-1 enters period t after being discounted by a factor λ. I find that, on average, increasing the discounted stock of offline ad investments by 10% increases the volume of clicks recorded on search ads by more than 9%. Thus, the effectiveness of online ads also depends on the investment offline, making both types of media complementary. Figure 1: Relationship between Clicks on Online Ads and Offline Advertising Overall, my results suggest that offline and online advertisements are not close substitutes. Looking at how both types of media work, the way advertisers use them and how consumers react to them, offline and internet advertising are different, and sometimes complementary, markets. "},{"title":"Context Matters!​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Maths Men: The Economics of Online Advertising","url":"blog/Economics_online_ad#context-matters","content":"The ability to finely-target advertisements has allowed brands to better match their message to consumers. Targeted advertising thus generates gains by reducing ad ‘waste’6 (which occurs whenever the ad is distributed to a consumer who has no preference for the product advertised). However, focusing solely on individual targeting obliterates an important factor: context. In many cases, internet advertising as been subject to placement issues: an ad may be placed on an unviewable part of the page or worse, inside a bad context. The latter case includes ads displayed on controversial websites (e.g., conspiracy-related blogs, pornographic websites), or inside a content that is irrelevant to the ad: in 2012, an ad for cruise vacations run on a YouTube showing the sinking of the Costa Concordia7. There are many other examples. This kind of issue arises from an information asymmetry between the advertiser and the publisher. Online advertising features so many possible ad placements and the process of matching ads to placements is so complex that, eventually, advertisers rarely know where their ad appears. Without carefully considering contextual effects, advertisers may waste their ad budget, and even harm their brand image by appearing in bad contexts. Two works of my studies try to shed light on such contextual effects. In a first study, I use data from a viewability provider to investigate the determinant of ad viewability. The data showed that more than 20% of video ads for a healthcare advertiser were never seen. I try to investigate the determinant of ad viewability. Using an econometric model, I show that when the ad network did not have incentives to make ads viewable, it reduced the overall viewability rate of the campaign. Buying ads on a cost-per-view instead of cost-per-impressions basis induces the ad network to make the ad viewable, increasing viewability by almost 20%. Programmatic advertising also deters ad viewability by introducing opacity between the advertiser and the publisher. In a second study, I investigate how controversial content on socials impact advertising effectiveness. I use the 2020 Facebook Ad Boycott as a natural experiment. In July 2020, more than 1,000 advertisers pulled out their ad spending from Facebook and Instagram as both platforms were hosting controversial content. Using data from an advertiser in the skincare industry that continued to advertise, I estimate how Facebook ad effectiveness changed compared to the brand’s ads on other platforms. Controlling for platform-specific effectiveness and seasonality, I find that during the boycott, Facebook Ads experienced a decrease of up to 10,000 clicks compared to the expected effectiveness of the ads. Figure 2: Effect of the boycott (week 0) on clicks recorded on Facebook Ads. Estimates are reported with 95% confidence interval.

Since 2020, political initiatives foster consumer protection, privacy, and abuse of dominance in the digital economy. This has at least two implications for online advertising. First, for antitrust purposes market regulators need to define the relevant market for advertising. Does regulation on the online ad market affect offline advertising? Does Google Ads compete with national TV networks? Such questions are crucial to understand the market power of online advertising players. This thesis brings some insight from this perspective. Second, the strengthening of personal data regulation, along the end of third-party cookies will emphasize the importance of ad context. As targeting individual-level characteristics will be more and more difficult, brands will gain in leveraging context to target their ads. For example, targeting hotel ads on travel blog pages is a way to reach relevant consumers. Finally, cookies limitation will impact advertiser’s ability to finally measure the return of their advertisement.

Questioning how we do our business is an essential part of our “Mission”. Built on our rigorous GenAI, Data Engineering, Responsible AI and MLOps standards, it is a packaged product that showcases our expertise in creating and implementing GenAI solutions for businesses, which enhance efficiency by streamlining workflows and standardizing processes. We share our approach, tech stack, and implementation insights, showcasing how this kind of automation can drive impactful ESG business decisions. Introduction​ Ekimetrics' Sustainability Report1 showcases our company’s commitment to embedding sustainability into its operations, processes, and services. Assessing the sustainability practices of clients and prospects enables us to ensure that our services contribute to positive impact, rather than enabling unsustainable business models. The tool described in this article, the Client ESG Due Diligence Tool, plays a crucial role in this endeavour. The tool automates client company evaluation, providing structured insights that help identify risks, as well as areas where Ekimetrics can support clients in improving their own sustainability efforts. It is a similar concept to the classic “supplier due diligence” ESG-check, except that here, we question our downward value chain for its sustainability alignment, rather than the upward value chain. The tool is, in essence, a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an AI framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to answer user queries more precisely, and in specialised domains. This kind of architecture ensures that responses are based on factual data, rather than only the model’s pre-trained knowledge, and enhances explainability by providing references to the text used for generating responses. Such optimisation avoids having to go through the expensive and complex process of training a dedicated LLMs for a specific topic. The tool is built upon Ekimetrics’ rigorous standards in GenAI, Data Engineering, MLOps and Responsible AI, ensuring reliability, scalability and trustworthiness. This work is reflective of our expertise in developing robust GenAI software solutions that drive business operational efficiency, by streamlining workflows, freeing up valuable time from maintenance, for innovation, as well as providing standardisation to processes. We believe this specific solution – an automated due diligence based on documentation – is, indeed, applicable, and valuable, to other business settings, so in this paper we share, in detail, our approach, showcasing the tech stack and technical implementation of the solution. How the Tool is Used​ ESG due diligence allows partners, managers, and commercial teams at Ekimetrics to determine how well a client company aligns with our own sustainability goals. Ekimetrics’ ESG due diligence process involves analysing company reports that are, publicly available online, such as financial reports, sustainability reports, supplier code of conduct, charter and certifications, and other company documentation, and extracting relevant information in order to answer predefined ESG-specific questions. If done manually, this process can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, risking inconsistent assessments and delayed decision-making. The Client ESG Due Diligence tool is designed to address these pain points, in a way that is intuitive and user friendly. It consists of a dashboard – the Document Upload Dashboard – where users can upload company documents, which are then used to automatically carry out the due diligence and to calculate company risk scores (Figure 1). The dashboard also facilitates the search for scores of existing and already-screened companies and the download of the full company diligence report (Figure 2). Finally, a specialised chatbot, available directly on the same dashboard, assists users in developing a deeper understanding of the screened companies, and helps them identify new opportunities where Ekimetrics could support clients on their own sustainability practices (Figure 3). The tool also allows the user to check existing company documents in the database, as well as past due diligence reports, which helps them assess the date and reliability of the scores. The more documents provided for a client company, the more accurate their ESG risk score. Figure 1 – Users can upload company documents on the Document Upload Dashboard The Due Diligence Questionnaire​ The due diligence questionnaire consists of a mixture of questions that, either apply to all companies, or that are industry specific. The questions are labelled by the categories shown in Table 1, and include questions such as “Does {the company} have a sustainability policy to promote diversity and inclusion?” (as an example of the general question) or “Does {company} have a strategy with clear targets and timelines to switch to renewable energy sources?” (as an example of an industry-specific question for the Transportation/Mobility sector). Each question is answered by the tool automatically, basing the response only on the company documents provided by the user. The questions have been developed by Ekimetrics’ ESG team, with the support of an external consultant to ensure the relevance and alignment on international frameworks. The tool allows for the questions to evolve over time. Table 1 – Topics and categories of Ekimetrics’ client ESG due diligence The Company Report​ Each company's report is generated as an Excel file containing automatically produced responses to both general and industry-specific questions. For each answer, the report includes the supporting references, detailing the extracted text along with the document name and page number. This structure allows users to delve into the specifics and assess the reliability of each response as needed. Scores are then calculated based on the number of affirmative answers, as outlined in the following section. The Scoring System​ Figure 2 shows that for each client there are multiple scores. In fact, we derive thirteen elementary scores: one for each of the categories listed in Table 1one for the general questionsone for the industry questionsone total score – i.e. for all the questions and one composite score, made up of the policy, reporting and certifications scores. The elementary scores are calculated as the proportion of questions that have “yes” as an answer, out of all the questions. The composite score is the sum of the policy, reporting and or certification scores, depending on the industry sector (see Table 2). Figure 2 – Check the scores for a company Once a score is calculated, deciding how to engage with the client is an automated process, based on a decision tree (Figure 3). The decision tree is not only dependent on the score, but also the industry sector. First, industry sectors are categorised into four groups of risk: critical risk, high risk, medium risk, and no risk. By default, we willingly engage in business with companies that fall in the no risk industry sectors category, which include green technologies and renewable energy. As a matter of policy, Ekimetrics does not engage in work with companies in critical risk industry sectors. For the high and medium risk categories, Ekimetrics’ engagement is determined by their commercial and sustainability goals, strategies, and commitments. Table 2 – Procedure for calculating the composite risk score depending on the industry sector. Figure 3 – Decision tree on how to engage with clients – the actual threshold of acceptance for each industry sectors within a particular risk category also has a range and depends on the specific sector. The Chatbot​ Figure 4 shows the chatbot tab on the User Interface (UI). The user selects the company they want to explore, and asks a question on the dedicated window. The tool answers all questions based only on the available company documents as well as the history of their conversation. Further, following our company’s standards for Responsible AI [5], specifically the Explainability pillar, all parts of the answer are referenced to specific text in the resources section of the page. Figure 4 – Specialised chatbot that helps the user to understand the company more deeply. The Global Assessment Dashboard​ This resource displays summarised visualisations of all the scores for all the client companies in the database (Figure 5), allowing top management, commercial and sustainability leads to understand the overall ESG performance of our client-base at a glance. This can help them identify high-risk companies, and assist them to prioritize industry sectors for sustainability improvements and strategic engagement. As the tool is built on PowerBI, it enables easy manipulation and filtering of the data, allowing the user to focus on specific sectors, companies, or groups of companies that fall within a specific range of a score, or are a particular risk category. Figure 5 - The Global Assessment Dashboard User feedback​ From Renaud Pirel (Partner at Ekimetrics): We all carry unconscious biases when assessing the &quot;ESG compliance&quot; of a particular industry or business. Leveraging a data-driven tool helps us make more objective decisions and stay aligned with our mission at Ekimetrics.

These powerful tools have transformed our understanding of what machines can achieve, rivalling human cognition in many areas. In just a few short years, LLMs have evolved from generating pseudo-coherent text in English (GPT-2; 2019) to enormous models that possess knowledge besting most human experts in specific domains (o1, claude 3.5; 2024). At Ekimetrics, we're thrilled to be working with clients to harness the potential of these new technologies, exploring exciting applications such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), KPI extraction, or social media content generation. We use LLMs to manage and format knowledge in all its forms. Our team has witnessed first-hand the incredible capabilities of LLMs, and we're eager to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible. However, despite their impressive abilities, even the best LLMs are still not without weaknesses. In this article, we'll delve into concrete examples of LLMs struggling with seemingly trivial tasks and attempt to understand the underlying reasons for these failures. By exploring the limitations of LLMs, we hope to gain a deeper appreciation for their capabilities and develop strategies to overcome their weaknesses, ultimately unlocking their full potential. The observations and insights shared in this article are purely my personal perspective, drawn from extensive experience working with Large Language Models (LLMs) in both research and production environments. As someone deeply immersed in this field at Ekimetrics, I recognize that LLMs are fundamentally complex &quot;black box&quot; systems. The examples and analysis that follow represent my professional observations and interpretations, but they are not definitive scientific conclusions. All the examples below are generated using the latest version of ChatGPT available as of October 21, 2024. I chose ChatGPT because it is the most widely used and well-known access to an LLMs for most people, and it hosts state-of-the-art models from OpenAI. All messages you see are the first answers I got from ChatGPT, there are no previous messages, and no system prompt. As a bonus, see o1 answers at the end of the article. It only get 1 out of the 3 examples right. Misguided Attention​ In the realm of large language models (LLMs), one intriguing phenomenon that often leads to errors is what we could refer to as misguided attention. This occurs when a LLM encounters a problem or prompt that closely resembles a well-known scenario it has encountered during its training. The model, recognizing the familiar pattern, may prematurely jump to conclusions without fully processing the nuances of the current situation. This is akin to a human cognitive bias known as the Einstellung effect, where prior experience with similar problems causes individuals to apply previously learned solutions inappropriately. A classic example of this is the &quot;Dead Schrödinger's cat&quot; scenario. In this twist on the famous thought experiment, a dead cat is placed into a box alongside a nuclear isotope, a vial of poison, and a radiation detector. If the detector picks up radiation, it releases the poison. The question is: &quot;What is the probability of the cat being alive when the box is opened a day later?&quot; Now watch what happens if we ask ChatGPT this simple question: Almost all LLMs, upon encountering this problem, default to their learned response from Schrödinger's original paradox, which involves a living cat in a superposition of states. They fail to consider the critical twist—that the cat starts out dead. This oversight occurs because the model's attention latches onto the familiar elements of the problem and neglects to process the new information. Some kind of &quot;Oh! I already know this one!&quot; effect. This phenomenon is intricately tied to the way these models are trained. LLMs are trained on massive datasets comprising diverse text inputs from the internet, books, articles, and other sources. During this training process, the models learn to identify patterns, structures, and associations within the data. They use these patterns to generate predictions about the next token in a sequence, based on the context provided by preceding tokens. This ability to predict and generate text is largely driven by statistical correlations rather than true understanding or reasoning. As a result, LLMs develop a keen sense for recognizing familiar patterns and scenarios that resemble those they have encountered during training. This can lead them to quickly latch onto well-known narratives or problem templates, even when subtle differences or new information require a different approach. The reliance on pattern recognition means that when a LLM encounters a prompt that closely mirrors a familiar scenario, it may default to the response it has learned for that scenario, without noticing new elements in the context. Even when new elements can be as critical as in this example. This is akin to how humans sometimes rely on heuristics or mental shortcuts based on past experiences, potentially leading to errors in judgment when faced with novel situations. Understanding this aspect of LLM training helps illuminate why misguided attention occurs and underscores the importance of developing strategies to mitigate its effects. The challenge of misguided attention highlights both the potential and the pitfalls of LLMs. While their power lies in pattern recognition, enabling them to draw from vast reserves of knowledge, this same reliance can sometimes become their worst enemy when they encounter novel twists on familiar themes. By understanding these limitations and refining how we use LLMs, we can continue to enhance their reasoning capabilities, all the while mitigating risks such as hallucinations for our clients, thus unlocking even more sophisticated applications in natural language processing. Following instructions​ LLMs are fundamentally constrained by their next-token prediction mechanism, generating text one token at a time without the ability to revise previous output. Unlike humans, who can reflect on and adjust their thoughts during writing, LLMs are locked into a linear, sequential process. This limitation can lead to inconsistencies or unintended outputs, especially when handling specific formatting requirements. In the next example, I ask the model to write sentences that end with a particular word. To give you an idea of how bad LLMs are at this task, I couldn’t even use one to reflect on the error, because they do not see any problem and consider the task completed with success. We can only try to guess why LLMs fail so spectacularly at this task. Here is my guess. While writing the sentence, the LLMs can only predict the next token. They “know” they must include “houses” in the sentence but the sense of writing nice sentences seems to overtake their will to respect the user instructions. Often the sentence could have ended after the token “houses”, as if the model had planned to stop, but it can’t help but adding a few more words for the sentence to sound nice. When using ChatGPT through the API, we can observe this behavior but cannot directly modify the model's output process. However, if we were to work with a local model where we have more control, we could potentially address this by forcing the model to stop at the desired word by manually inserting end-of-sentence tokens like &quot;.\\n&quot; immediately after the target word. We could also investigate on the learned probabilities to select the next tokens in those situations, to estimate the willingness of the model to follow instructions over writing nice sentences. Numbers​ LLMs perceive language as a sequence of tokens, rather than words and numbers. This tokenization process can lead to difficulties when processing numbers or proper nouns, as the model struggles to understand the context and relationships between these entities. For instance, when faced with mathematical equations, LLMs may falter, as they're forced to rely on statistical patterns rather than true comprehension of the operations to make. The numerical comparison error in the image illustrates an interesting limitation of LLMs. In this instance, the model incorrectly concludes that 3.11 is greater than 3.9. The reason for this error may lie in how software version numbers are typically formatted - for example, Python releases follow a sequence like 2.0, 2.1, ..., 2.9, 2.10. Since the model has frequently encountered version numbers where 3.9 precedes 3.11, and commonly sees phrases like &quot;version 3.9 or higher&quot; (which includes 3.10 and 3.11), this pattern may have influenced its numerical reasoning. The model has thus learned this relationship between these numbers but struggles to discern that context matters and that by default the number 3.9 remains larger than the number 3.11. This also helps explain why it seems confused in its explanation &quot;since 90 is bigger than 11, 3.9 is smaller than 3.11&quot;. It's almost like the model &quot;knows&quot; his first take was wrong but is too afraid to look bad by correcting itself. This example is perfect to explain why chain-of-thoughts -before answering- are crucial for LLMs. Asking the model to explain its reasoning after it already gave its answer is just glorified post-hoc rationalization. However, prompting the model to write a justification before its answer can help it navigate the complexity of the task more effectively, leading to a more accurate final response. Despite their remarkable achievements, LLMs continue to exhibit vulnerabilities in seemingly simple tasks. Through our exploration of misguided attention, next-token prediction limitations, and tokenization challenges, we've seen how these powerful models can still stumble in unexpected ways. These limitations remind us that LLMs process language very differently from humans. Understanding these shortcomings is crucial not just for academic interest, but for practical applications in business settings. At Ekimetrics, this knowledge helps us design more robust solutions by anticipating potential pitfalls and implementing appropriate guardrails, such as chain-of-thought prompting. As the field continues to evolve, with models like OpenAI's o1 showing promising improvements, we remain both optimistic about the future potential of LLMs and mindful of their current limitations. This balanced perspective is essential for anyone working to harness these powerful tools effectively. Bonus: o1 answers​ o1 is the latest model by OpenAI and n°1 LLM on most -and especially logical- benchmarks. It uses chain-of-thought techniques to process user requests, decomposing and analyzing information before giving its final answer. One might think this state-of-the-art model, made to think, reflect, and perform complex tasks, would ace those examples. This is also what I thought, before testing the model on those same prompts. Of the three tricky examples I chose, they only got 3.9 &gt; 3.11 correct.

Each modality contains potential predictive information, for instance to forecast future demand or sales.Medical records include textual documents, tabular data, images, regular or irregular time series. Here again, for each patient, every modality may contain precious information to help diagnosis or prognosis.Advertisements, e-mails, newspaper covers and articles and social media posts are usually bimodal: texts combined with one or several images (and sometimes, texts within images).

Each sense (or each modality) is correctly interpreted thanks to the knowledge of all other signals: To know if the noise I heard on my right reveals a danger, I must concentrate my vision sense to the same direction (maybe turn my head) and look at the source of the noise.Imagine that someone shows me a document and gives oral explanations. Something sounds weird in these explanations. To know if my interlocutor is serious or joking, I must stop looking at the document, and look at his/her facial expression.To select what to pay attention to in this famous awareness test, I must know and understand the written instructions (or game rule).As a specialist physician, to avoid missing weak signals in exam results (imagery, blood test history…) and symptoms, I must understand why the patient was sent to me, which means reading the cover letter or medical report, so as to know what to focus on.In many bimodal documents, for instance scientifical articles, understanding the images (diagrams, charts) help understanding the text, and reading some texts (e.g. captions) can be necessary to understand the images or to deduce what is important to be watched in the image. If all these examples, suppose each modality is observed by a different person (a different unimodal brain), without any communication with the other persons, and afterwards, only afterwards, these persons can communicate and decide, without any access to the modalities. What will happen? They will probably miss something, because they did not look in the right direction, or did not focus enough on some detail, or misinterpreted a signal.

Each unimodal brain classically produces a unimodal embedding, which is usually a vector (1D-array) or a sequence of vectors (2D-array) of numerical values, which is supposed to concentrate all useful information on the modality, in a reduced mathematical space. Then, a prediction is built from all these gathered embeddings, thanks to the addition of a few more trained neural layers (a “head” block), or with numerical machine learning solutions such as tree boosting. It looks SoTA, but it often induces poor performance. The first reason is that each unimodal embedding is given in a different latent space: it means that it uses a language which is completely different from the other unimodal embeddings. Thus, the image embedding does not help guessing what is important to check in the text embedding, and vice versa. In the human scenario (unimodal brains), it would be as if the involved persons could not communicate correctly together: making a good decision would be quite unlikely. Fortunately, public pre-trained models and architectures called dual encoders, like CLIP1 , can produce text embeddings and image embeddings in the same latent space (same language), which significantly helps bridging the gap between modalities, and improve predictive performance. But this is not enough. You already know the second reason: even with dual encoders, each unimodal brain (network) does not communicate with the other brains when analyzing its modality, and therefore, does not focus enough on what is important in it. This is why a new family of multimodal models has been designed: fusion encoders. They allow, in each modality analysis, to progressively introduced useful information from other modalities. Thus, useful information is jointly extracted from all modalities of a same data sample. Pretrained image &amp; text (bimodal) fusion encoders, ingeniously assembling SoTA expertise of both computer vision and natural language processing, are now publicly available: ViLT2 , FLAVA3 , BLIP4 , BLIP-25 … They can output bimodal embeddings, which contain rich relevant information from a pair {image, text}, analyzed together. They are excellent candidates for “transfer learning” strategies: adding a trained “head” network on top of a fine-tuned fusion encoder, to make the desired prediction or forecast.

For instance, an irrelevant picture (product photo) may have been associated to an unmatching product. Manual thorough detection of errors, on millions of products, would be extremely costly. At Ekimetrics Innovation Lab (Eki.Lab), we have designed, built, evaluated, and validated a deep learning solution to efficiently semi-automate that task: it can detect most mismatches between an image and the known text fields (name, properties, description, summary…) of the same product. Our most efficient solution mainly relies on a fine-tuned fusion encoder and trained head. Even with artificially generated hard-to-find image permutations (e.g. replacing an image with a similar but slightly different one) in test database, our solution can detect 87% (recall) of existing mismatches, with a tolerated precision of 50% (i.e. allowing that that only 1 suspicious image out of 2 is actually incorrect). On top of that, we have designed and validated a method to adapt the model to any unlabeled product database (self-supervision): costly human labelling is unnecessary. Our experiments confirm that without a fusion encoder, and even using CLIP as a dual encoder, results are much worse: recall remains under 30% with the same constraint on precision.

However, a few recent research papers, such as the Perceiver family (Perceiver6 , Perceiver IO7 , Hierarchical Perceiver8 ), show promising ways to build and train an accurate unique (fusion) deep learning model based on any combination of various modalities. Combining such a “multimodal-by-design” architecture with pre-trained models (including fusion encoders) for both text and images, which may still bring useful knowledge with small-sized training datasets, is an active field of research9 , in which Ekimetrics is fully involved. A high range of disruptive use cases can be designed: in the near future, efficient multimodal models will help optimize media communication, forecast demand or sales to optimize product design or supply chain, forecast or optimize prices, help diagnosis or prognosis, perform impactful social media analysis… Please stay connected for future news on the subject! « Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision », A.

We had the chance to work with many epidemiological experts, and as we went along we built a toolbox to facilitate our modeling of the current pandemics. We then put this toolbox in open source under the name pyepidemics to contribute to the community on this scientific discipline difficult to apprehend for Data Scientists but with obvious bridges facilitating innovation. Today, with the resurgence of the epidemic in Europe, it seemed important to present this library more widely to democratize these analyses on a larger scale. The library is available on Github at this linkThe documentation is available at this link This article will serve as a synthetic presentation of what can be done with the library, please refer to the documentation for more details. Do not hesitate to post issues on Github and to contribute with new proposals, the development is still in experimental version. Introduction to Pyepidemics​ Pyepidemics allows to simply create compartmental epidemiological models (also used in system dynamics) and to solve the differential equations that model the phenomenon. The different features implemented today are: Creation of classical compartmental models (SIR, SEIR, SEIDR, etc...)Creation of COVID19 related model (with ICU and different levels of symptoms)Creation of custom compartmental modelImplementation of policies (lockdown, tracing, testing, etc...)Calibration of epidemiological parameters on real-world data using Bayesian optimization Installation​ You can simply install pyepidemics using the command pip install pyepidemics Introduction to epidemiological modeling in Python​ The images, the reasoning and the construction of the first bricks of the library are largely inspired by the exceptional work of Henri Froese with his series of articles on epidemiology, in particular the first article Infectious Disease Modelling: Beyond the Basic SIR Model. Compartmental models​ An epidemic is modeled with the different possible states for the population, for example: unaffected, immunized, vaccinated, symptomatic patient, asymptomatic patient, hospitalized, in intensive care ... Each state will be modeled with a compartment, and the population will transition between the different compartments according to parameters of probability and transition duration. In concrete terms, this means solving a system of differential equations as a function of time. For example the simplest compartmental model is the SIR model (for the 3 states Susceptible - Infected - Removed). It is possible to write the following compartments with their transition: The transition parameters being given by : Building a SIR model with pyepidemics​ This section is detailed in this tutorial which is also available directly on Colab. Using the bank of models​ As the SIR model is a standard model, you can find an already coded version in the model bank. We will learn in the next section how this abstraction is built to allow you to add details in the modeling. With pyepidemics: from pyepidemics.models import SIR N = 1000 # Thousand persons beta = 3/4 # One person contaminates 3/4 person per day gamma = 1/4 # One person stay infected for 4 days sir = SIR(N,beta,gamma) It is then possible to solve the system of differential equations simply with the method .solve() (more parameters are available, see the tutorial quoted above : states = sir.solve() states.show(plotly = False) What is commonly called an epidemic &quot;wave&quot; is observed. Reimplementing the SIR model​ Let's now go into the internal workings of this abstraction to reimplement its operation in a few lines of code. Concretely we build a graph between the different states by detailing the transitions. Pyepidemics then translates this graph into a system of differential equations in order to solve it. from pyepidemics.models import CompartmentalModel class SIR(CompartmentalModel): def __init__(self,N,beta,gamma): # Define compartments name and number compartments = [&quot;S&quot;,&quot;I&quot;,&quot;R&quot;] super().__init__(compartments) # Parameters self.N = N # Total population self.beta = beta # How many person each person infects per day self.gamma = gamma # Rate of infection, duration = 1/gamma # Add transition self.add_transition(&quot;S&quot;,&quot;I&quot;,lambda y,t: self.beta * y[&quot;S&quot;] * y[&quot;I&quot;] / self.N) self.add_transition(&quot;I&quot;,&quot;R&quot;,lambda y,t: self.gamma * y[&quot;I&quot;]) So it is possible to build any kind of compartmental model with this operation. You can see more complex examples in this tutorial. Create a realistic epidemiological model for COVID19​ In the first section we saw how to build a SIR model, however we are far from being able to use this model to simulate an epidemic like COVID19 and for governments to be able to take actions using those analyses. For this we would need to: Have a more complete description taking into account the specifics of the disease statesTake into account the mitigation strategies provided by governmentsCalibrate the model to describe the evolution of the epidemic as closely as possible Build the right compartmental model​ Indeed, the COVID19 is more specific than simply the 3 SIR states described above. During the year 2020, we used the following compartmental model inspired by the work of the Pasteur Institute and the INSERM (taking into account the different levels of symptoms, the incubation phase, and the passages in hospital or in intensive care) You can look in the library at the implementation of the COVID19 model to see the implementation (very close to what has been described above for the SIR model, one of the strengths of pyepidemics). Describe the mitigation solutions implemented (containment, testing)​ Some parameters, such as the famous &quot;R0&quot;, have varied enormously during the epidemic depending on behaviors (distancing, masks), policies (testing, lockdowns, vaccination), or variants of the epidemic. Thus, to create a realistic model, we need to take these variations into account. We will take the example of the first lockdowns to understand how to implement these variations with pyepidemics. Let's create an evolution of the parameter R(t) according to the different lockdowns (during the first wave for example) from pyepidemics.policies.utils import make_dynamic_fn policies = [ 3.3/4, (1/4,53), (2/4,80), ] fn = make_dynamic_fn(policies,sigmoid = False) # Create our time-dependent parameter beta = lambda y,t : fn(t) # Visualize policies x = np.linspace(0,100) y = np.vectorize(fn)(x) plt.figure(figsize = (15,4)) plt.plot(x,y) plt.show() And that's it! We can use this time-dependent parameter like we used a constant before. To see more complete examples and results, you can redirect to this tutorial. Find the most appropriate parameters for calibration​ Finally, in the previous example, as in those before, we chose arbitrarily the values of the different probabilities and transition times. But these are precisely what epidemiologists want to estimate. How does this work? Simply by testing different parameters until the solution of the compartmental model matches as much as possible the real evolution of the epidemic. Of course, we are not going to test all the combinations but rather : Start with an a priori on the different parameter values from the most recent epidemiological studies Use a Bayesian optimization algorithm to go through the parameter space efficiently without having to calculate everything. These two methods are easy to implement with pyepidemics if we have a pyepimemics model with a .reset() method that recreates a compartmental model with the new set of parameters. First we create a parameter space to explore: space = { &quot;beta_low&quot;:(0.01,0.4), &quot;beta_high&quot;:(0.6,1.5), &quot;I0&quot;:(0,100), &quot;recovery_rate_asymptomatic&quot;:(1/8,1/2), &quot;recovery_rate_mild&quot;:(1/8,1/2), &quot;death_rate_hospital&quot;:(0.006,0.02), &quot;death_rate_icu&quot;:(0.006,0.02), &quot;recovery_rate_icu&quot;:(0.02,0.08), &quot;recovery_rate_hospital&quot;:(0.02,0.08), } Then we will simply use the method .fit() by giving as input a dataframe with the real values of the epidemic for the compartments for which we would have succeeded in obtaining data (in general the deaths and the hospital stays which are the most reliable). model.fit( cases[[&quot;D&quot;,&quot;H&quot;,&quot;ICU&quot;]], space, n = 200, early_stopping = 100, ) This step is not easy, takes time and often also requires iterations to change the definition of the compartmental model. But once solved it is what allows epidemiologists to follow the dynamics of the pandemic. More details on calibration are available in this tutorial. Conclusion​ With this article we could introduce you to our epidemiological modeling library pyepidemics - simple modeling, flexible compartmental models, calibration, dynamic parameters, etc... The details of the different features are available in the library documentation. As previously mentioned, this library is still under experimental development, we are still using it to model the 5th wave of the epidemic, in particular by adding compartments for vaccination - we will write an article on the modeling in the coming months. Do not hesitate to contribute to democratize this discipline to the Data Science community.

In our previous article, we established a conceptual framework distinguishing between the direct and indirect impact of communication, revealing the complexity of the mechanisms through which this sector influences our collective carbon footprint. Today, we transform this theoretical framework into a concrete measurement tool. In a context where companies are called upon to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 5% per year, the communication industry faces a fundamental question: how to evaluate and optimize its real contribution to the ecological transition? This question is all the more crucial as the recent French ministerial report proposes a transformation of climate contracts and increased regulation of commercial communications. To respond in a quantified manner, we have conducted an in-depth analysis distinguishing between the direct footprint (linked to agency and media activities) and the indirect footprint (resulting from generated consumption behaviors). Our study reveals an undeniable finding: while the direct footprint of the sector represents approximately 1.02 MtCO2e (or 0.27% of French national emissions), its indirect footprint reaches 16.55 MtCO2e, equivalent to 4.44% of the national carbon footprint. This ratio of 1 to 16 between direct and indirect impact persists even in our most conservative sensitivity analyses, where it varies from 4 to 80 depending on the assumptions. This disproportion upends the traditional perspective and demonstrates that beyond eco-designing campaigns, the sector's main lever for action lies in the strategic orientation of marketing investments. Direct Effect: Quantifying the Operational Footprint of Communication​ To evaluate the direct carbon footprint of the sector, two methodological approaches are available: The top-down approach relies on carbon assessments published by major players in the sector to estimate the overall impact of the industry. This method offers a macroscopic vision and allows capturing the diversity of communication professions.The bottom-up approach uses specific emission factors by type of activity to build an estimate from elementary processes. It allows a more granular analysis of emission sources. The table below synthesizes the strengths and limitations of each method: Table 1: Comparative study of methods for estimating the direct impact of communication. For this first global assessment, we favored the top-down approach, while recognizing that it may lead to a high estimate of the sector's footprint. Data from Major Communication Groups​ Our analysis is based on the CSR reports of the six largest global communication groups, whose carbon intensities (kgCO₂e/€) were calculated by relating their total emissions (scopes 1, 2, and 3) to their turnover: Table 2: Comparison of emissions from communications companies according to their level of activity * No clear location-based data were available for scope 2, therefore market-based emissions might have been used. ** Average conversion factor was used for the year to turn the data in euro *** Scope 3 covers only aviation, so the data were ignored This analysis reveals an interesting trend: French groups (Publicis, Havas) present a significantly lower carbon intensity than their international counterparts. This difference could be explained by earlier sensitivity to environmental issues in France or by specificities in the structure of activities. However, the variation remains contained within a factor of 1 to 4, suggesting a certain sectoral consistency. For our national estimate, we retained the average value of 0.031 kgCO₂e/€, which represents a prudent and robust approximation of the sector's carbon intensity. Carbon Footprint of the Sector in France​ According to data from Arcom (Arcom, 2024), the business volume of communication in France amounts to 33 billion euros, divided between media (52%) and non-media (48%). By applying our average carbon intensity factor of 0.031 kgCO₂e/€ to this activity volume, we obtain a direct footprint of 1.02 MtCO₂e for the entire sector, or about 0.27% of French national emissions (373 MtCO₂e in 2023 according to CITEPA, 2024). This estimate, although significant, places the communication sector among moderate contributors to direct national emissions. However, as we will see in the next section, this vision captures only a fraction of the sector's real environmental impact. Indirect Effect: Measuring the Impact of Communication on Consumption​ After quantifying the direct operational footprint of communication, we tackle a more complex challenge: evaluating its impact on consumption behaviors and, consequently, on the associated greenhouse gas emissions. Review of Scientific Literature​ Our approach is based on an in-depth analysis of academic studies and gray literature. We identified two main categories of relevant publications: ROI aggregation studies that estimate the economic effectiveness of communication at the advertiser level.Macroeconomic analyses that measure the effect of advertising on consumption volume and GDP growth. Figure 1: Decomposition of measured effects as a function of the observed variable. The table below summarizes the main international studies on the subject: Table 3: Summary of analyses on the impact of communication Methodology: Translating Economic Impact into Carbon Footprint​ To establish a robust method, we distinguished three different approaches in these studies: ROI aggregation without accounting for the adverse effect between competitorsEstimation of overall impact on consumption (useful for modeling contribution to growth)Calculation of marginal impact allowing modeling of the effect of variations in investments We favored the results of the &quot;Value of Advertising&quot; study (Deloitte, 2017) as a starting point, while adjusting them by a corrective factor integrating the more moderate results of other publications. Structuring Hypotheses​ Our model is based on three fundamental hypotheses: Hypothesis of communication market efficiency: We consider that media and non-media, each representing about 50% of investments, generate an equivalent median ROI.Hypothesis of marginality of the price effect: The price effect is considered secondary compared to the market growth effect. The work of Dubois, Griffith, and O'Connell (Dubois, 2018, p. 421) on the British chip market shows that a total stop of advertising would generate only an increase in price sensitivity of less than 3%.Hypothesis of GDP-Energy-Carbon correlation: We rely on the work of Giraud (Giraud, 2014) demonstrating the strong historical correlation between GDP and energy consumption, allowing us to establish a carbon intensity factor per euro of GDP. For methodological prudence, we did not integrate the adverse effect (redistribution between competitors) in our model, which leads to a minimal estimate of the potential impact of communication. Calculation of the Indirect Footprint​ Our approach breaks down into three steps: Step 1: Estimation of generated consumption We start with the GDP generation factor of €7.85 per euro invested (Deloitte, 2017), which we adjust by a corrective factor of 0.48 to reflect the average of other studies (ratio 0.43/0.9 between the average impact and that of the reference study). Calculation: €33 billion (communication investment) × 7.85 (GDP factor) × 0.48 (corrective factor) = €125.2 billion of additional consumption generated by communication in France. Step 2: Conversion to carbon intensity We calculate the average carbon intensity of French GDP by dividing national emissions by GDP: National emissions 2023: 373 MtCO₂e (CITEPA, 2024)French GDP 2023: €2,822.5 billion (INSEE, 2024) Yielding an intensity of 0.13 kgCO₂e per euro of GDP. Step 3: Calculation of the indirect footprint By applying this carbon intensity to the generated consumption: €125.2 billion × 0.13 kgCO₂e/€ = 16.55 MtCO₂e This indirect footprint represents approximately 4.44% of the French national carbon footprint, or more than 16 times the direct impact of the sector. This result underlines the critical importance of considering the influence of communication on consumption behaviors when evaluating its overall environmental impact. Conclusion: Transforming Communication into a Lever for Ecological Transition​ Our study reveals a fundamental truth for the communication industry: with 94% of its carbon impact coming from indirect effects versus only 6% from direct impact, the sector must profoundly rethink its contribution to the ecological transition. This disproportion, robust even in our most conservative sensitivity analyses, demonstrates that eco-designing campaigns, while necessary, cannot suffice given the scale of the challenge. The real issue lies in the strategic orientation of the €125.2 billion of additional consumption generated each year by the sector in France. How can this considerable influence be transformed into a positive force for the planet? At Ekimetrics, we have developed the MM4S (Marketing Mix for Sustainability) methodology to precisely answer this question. Our approach quantifies and optimizes the dual dimension of marketing: Its traditional commercial performanceIts overall environmental impact Our analyses demonstrate that a strategic reallocation of marketing budgets can simultaneously improve sales and reduce the carbon footprint. In practice, this means: Reducing advertising pressure on high-impact productsAccelerating the visibility of sustainable offeringsObjectively quantifying marketing's contribution to the company's environmental objectives At a time when regulations are rapidly evolving, this data-driven approach allows companies to anticipate future constraints while transforming their communication into a real lever for ecological transition. Because the message is clear: communication can no longer be content with greening its image – it must become a measurable catalyst for the transformation of our consumption patterns. Faced with this observation, professionals in the sector now have the opportunity to reinvent their profession, combining marketing expertise and environmental responsibility. It is this new paradigm that Ekimetrics accompanies, with concrete solutions to measure, pilot, and optimize the global impact of your marketing investments. Cited Works​ Arcom. (2024).

Attempting to estimate the closest value to reality without considering all risk-related factors refers to accuracy. This approach leans more toward a retrospective examination of past errors. Considering the stochastic nature of the universe, we aim to approach interval within which the true values will fall, considering potential future risks and potential future errors. We're no longer referring to point forecasting but rather interval forecasting. The need to quantify uncertainty can arise in various ways, for example: Uncertainty forecasting helps energy companies make decisions about buying and selling energy in real-time markets, considering fluctuations in demand and supply Forecasting uncertainty in demand and supply can help retail businesses optimize their production, distribution processes and stock management Hospitals can use uncertainty forecasts to anticipate patient admissions, enabling better resource allocation, staffing decisions and pharmaceutical orders  The most important thing to keep in mind is that even a good estimator can make important errors due to the volatility that a time series can present. To prevent this problem, the use of prediction intervals is recommended.

It involves generating multiple bootstrap samples through resampling, with replacement, from the original dataset. Subsequently, these samples undergo analysis employing the same statistical model. The results provide a range of values that represent the uncertainty associated with your forecast or analysis, offering a more nuanced understanding of potential fluctuations in outcomes. This approach provides a flexible and data-driven method to assess the precision of statistical estimates. Advantages of this approach include its utilization of non-parametric methods, requiring a minimal amount of data, and ease of implementation. However, the method has disadvantages such as demanding intensive computing resources, being highly dependent on input data, and posing challenges in terms of interpretation. "},{"title":"Asymmetric regression​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Uncertainty in time series forecasting","url":"blog/Uncertainty_TS#asymmetric-regression","content":"In machine learning, altering the loss function can reshape a model's predictions by influencing how it handles errors. During the training phase, a machine learning model learns to adjust its parameters to minimize the overall loss , but in the case of asymmetric loss functions, penalties for overestimations and underestimations are different. The optimization process involves balancing the penalties associated with overestimating and underestimating based on parameter values. Fine-tuning these parameters allows to adapt the model's behavior. This introduces a nuanced response to errors. Among other things, this is the principle behind quantile regression. Advantages of the approach include its compatibility with non-parametric methods . However, it comes with disadvantages such as the absence of mathematical guarantees, uncalibrated forecasts, and the complexity of interpretation associated with the method. "},{"title":"Probabilistic models​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Uncertainty in time series forecasting","url":"blog/Uncertainty_TS#probabilistic-models","content":"Probabilistic models are favored for their capacity to output distributions instead of single points estimates. Numerous probabilistic models exist for time series forecasting, and among them, ARIMA models are notably popular. The process begins with the model fitting the time series data, capturing the autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components, and ensuring stationarity through differencing (integrated component). After generating point forecasts, the model assesses the residuals, which represent the differences between the observed and predicted values. ARIMA utilizes the standard deviation of the normally distributed residuals to construct prediction intervals around the point forecasts. Essentially, the wider the prediction interval, the greater the uncertainty associated with the forecast. This technical methodology not only refines the accuracy of point forecasts but also provides a statistically sound measure of the range within which future observations are likely to fall. Advantages of this method include its simplicity and interpretability, along with the absence of a requirement for exogenous variables (even if it could be also a disadvantage). However, the method comes with disadvantages such as reliance on assumptions about the data and the need for parameter selection like most probabilistic methods.

It allows you to quantify uncertainty in your forecasts thanks to posterior distributions. Advantages of this approach include the ability to incorporate business knowledge and the possibility of extracting insights despite weakly informative datasets.

In addition to the usual testing and training datasets, the methodology also relies on a calibration set, which aids in generating conformalized intervals by rectifying errors introduced by the regressor. A crucial aspect in the design of conformal prediction is adaptivity. The objective is to ensure that the procedure yields larger intervals for more challenging inputs and smaller intervals for simpler inputs, tailoring the predictive uncertainty to the inherent difficulty of each input. Advantages of this method encompass mathematical coverage guarantees, consistent and robust performance, and applicability to any model or dataset. However, there are drawbacks, such as certain methods requiring intensive computing, which may pose challenges in a business application context, and a dependency on a good regressor.

This could suggest that the model oversimplifies the complexity of the problem, potentially overlooking crucial nuances in the data.

An adaptive model should effectively address variations in uncertainty within these sections, acknowledging potential diversity in conditions or characteristics. In summary, within the realm of uncertainty quantification evaluation, adaptability, exemplified through temporal and sectional adaptiveness, represents a comprehensive and nuanced approach that return larger sets for harder inputs and smaller sets for easier inputs.

Various methods, such as Bootstrap, Asymmetric Regression, Probabilistic Models, Bayesian Approach, and Conformal Prediction, offer diverse approaches, each with their respective advantages and disadvantages. Conformal prediction, a set of recent methods, still under research and development, holds the potential to outperform other approaches in the field. That's why, at Eki.Lab, we're pushing ahead with many studies linked to Conformal Prediction. The main points of evaluation we need to look at when evaluating these methods are coverage and adaptivity. We want our predictions to be able to evolve over time and across different dimensions of the dataset to ensure a good coverage rate whatever the particularities of the predicted observation. It's important to find a balance between keeping our uncertainty ranges narrow enough to be precise but also considering how much our predictions might vary.

Business Value​ The business case for talk-to-data solutions extends beyond technical innovation. We identified 3 primary value propositions that resonated with our first customer: Market validation has since strengthened our conviction: for instance, Uber reports a 70% reduction in SQL query authoring time through such tools, translating to an estimated 140,000 hours saved monthly (source: https://medium.com/wrenai/how-uber-is-saving-140-000-hours-each-month-using-text-to-sql-and-how-you-can-harness-the-same-fb4818ae4ea3). 3. Technical Challenges​ You might wonder: since RAGs have proven effective with LLMs like GPT-3.5, why wouldn't they suffice for database interactions? After all, databases are structured in tabular formats, seemingly eliminating the need for parsing, chunking, or preprocessing. However, despite the apparent simplicity of structured databases, four significant challenges make this task particularly complex: Ambiguity in Natural Language: varies from one user to another, and one question can have several answersComplex SQL syntax: You may need nested queries, aggregations, filters and conditionsSchema &amp; Naming Understanding: Alignment between the user question, the format of data, the naming of fields, and then the SQL... are not trivialError Sensitivity: small errors in SQL lead to invalid queries or incorrect results, unlike natural language, where minor errors are often tolerated. 4. Strategic Approach​ Our initial analysis identified four potential implementation strategies, evaluated against specificity and robustness: A pure text-to-sql LLMA text-to-sql LLM enhanced by various controls &amp; assistanceAggregation of data in automatically generated small tablesA very laborious pattern extraction model to try to match natural language pieces with predefined SQL pieces To fill in the gaps between these two axes, we chose the “text-to-SQL + controls” solution, and used the Vanna framework as our foundation to accelerate our developments. 5. Implementation Journey​ Architecture &amp; Initial Setup​ To begin with, we created an architecture fitting with the client environment &amp; the architects’ requirements. While the complete technical details are beyond this document's scope, here's a simplified overview: To launch our work, we reframed the business need: the customer only wanted an application that would enable them to query their database: one question, one answer, directly in the form of data. We quickly identified a critical challenge: how could business users without SQL expertise or familiarity with the available tables verify the accuracy and relevance of the answers? To address this issue, we immediately incorporated a natural language reformulation of the SQL query - which only addresses part of the problem, however. And to improve regularly the tool, we integrated human feedback loops through example pairs (question and SQL answer). Our initial implementation included: A dockerised architecture connecting back and front via FastAPIVanna 0.0.3xA GPT 3.5 turbo (to limit costs on iterations, which proved useful at first)Access to 2-3 tables in an initially fixed format Implementation Challenges &amp; Solutions​ Our work initially consisted of testing and identifying problems, the better to reflect on them and devise solutions. Working with limited-capability LLMs highlighted the importance of robust code and precise prompting. Here are the key challenges we encountered: We developed several solutions to address these challenges. Below are three key challenges and the solutions we developed: a/ Problems linked to the database:​ To manage problems linked to a change in the data (change of name, addition of field, modality, etc.), we created 3 types of referential that enabled us to observe and integrate table changes as automatically as possible, even when they were not communicated: A replica of the data dictionary (Excel) used by the data team, listing the table name, field, type, description and an example of a value.A configuration automatically generated from the data available at the time of generation, listing the table schemas (CREATE TABLE ...), and examples of SQL queries automatically translated into natural language, the main purpose of which is to link a word with a field in a table (list the countries France, GB and Germany // SELECT country FROM table_A WHERE country in (‘FRA’, ‘GBR’, ‘DEU’))A repository of field values in STRING format These repositories do not solve the fundamental problem of data instability and communication problems between teams, but they do provide a clear picture of what is being used, enable alerts to be raised quickly, and allow the most automatic possible adaptation to changes in the databases. Because the best response is above all to have real data governance, quality controls, bodies and processes for validating and communicating changes. b/ Problems linked to the lack of correspondence between the business language and the database language​ This is the major difficulty with TTD. There are several factors, and therefore several solutions: Unclear questions Example: what is the price of XXX -&gt; no date, no distinction between new and used, etc. Solution: Add default filters (e.g. most recent date)Choose one of several possible tables, and specify this in the SQL query reformulation in natural language.Solutions based on a multi-turn discussion with LLM: LLM points out the ambiguities of the formulation and asks for clarificationLLM shows what related data are available, and asks for clarificationLLM suggests a reformulation, and asks for validation before generating the SQL Questions that are too specific Example: ‘What is the price of X on 1 January at 1.03pm according to website Y in region Z?’ when the information is only available on average on a monthly basis. Solution: In general, the LLM responds as best it can, and rephrasing allows the user to be informed of the level of detail in the response. But be careful, too much detail can lead the LLM to add aberrant filters - which again is visible in the reformulation.Solutions based on a multi-turn discussion with LLM (see above) An implicit context Example: User A, living in France: what is the price of XXX? (implied: in France)User B, living in the UK: what is the price of XXX? (implied: in the UK) Solutions (not all integrated): Personalise the TTD with a simple prompt presenting the user's contextAdd default filters based on country, entity, etc. Unclear field names Example: field names such as ‘DL_MKT_TIME’. The description of the field allows the LLM to understand it, but the name of the field is very important. Solutions: Create views dedicated to TTDUse a business name in the TTD code, which will be replaced on the fly by its technical name when the request is made. Jargon in user questions Example: business abbreviations (‘bb’ for ‘buyback’, etc.). Solution: Specific jargon must necessarily be given to the LLM, either upstream (FT) or in the document base (which feeds the prompt).Hybrid search can be used to retrieve specific business vocabulary that is not well represented in the latent vector space. Table formats (aggregation, filter, etc.) of which the user is unaware, leading to complex or impossible queries Example: ‘what is the average selling price of X’ on a table aggregated by shop (requiring a weighted average). Solutions: Information &amp; instructions: The description of the tables and fields must be clear about their level of aggregation.More examples Safeguards: Identify certain patterns in the query, then raise an error with a corrective message for the LLMEven on-the-fly replacement of certain operations Specific field formats Example: two fields for a single word, several words in one field value, etc.Solution: in this case, the best solution is still to change the data. If this isn't possible and TTD doesn't work as expected, you can use ad-hoc prompts and fairly open SQL queries (e.g. ‘LIKE’ instead of ‘=’). c/ Performance drift &amp; speed of development​ To test the performance, a dedicated team of users asked regularly new questions (not the golden questions) to the tool on various tables &amp; topics, the metric being simply here the rate of correct answers on answerable questions. The final difficulty, linked to the high error sensitivity of text-2-sql, was its initial instability during development. To remedy this, two minimum solutions quickly became apparent. Any new change must be accompanied by a drift measurement (loss of reliability on questions that have already been mastered).By adding tables, new prompt elements can be confused with older ones, which were not designed at the same time. To counter this, a table assignment mechanism upstream of the chain should enable the LLM to be directed towards a list of candidate tables. 6. Future Outlook​ The landscape of talk-to-data solutions continues to evolve rapidly, with major players like Databricks and Google introducing interesting offerings. The Bird SQL benchmark continues to fill up with new records, and LLMs have greatly improved their code generation, thanks in particular to the ‘test time compute’ approach. But our experience shows that all these use cases will require the following fundamental elements: excellent data governance, a solid business sense on the part of the players responsible for maintaining text-to-SQL-based products, and well-parametrized tools to ensure robust responses - expertise and solutions that we've developed and proven to be consistently valuable. The future of text-to-SQL applications depends not just on technological advancement, but on the thoughtful integration of these fundamental elements.","keywords":"Text-to-SQL SQL Automation Data Governance Data Analysis AI in Business Large Language Models (LLM) SQL Query Generation AI Tools AI Development Challenges AI engineering R&D Deep Learning GenAI Natural Language Processing (NLP) GPT Models Database Management"},{"title":"Optimizing Chatbot Performance: A Two-Phase Methodology for Enhanced Performance in HR Policy Responses","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"blog/Wombat_HR","content":"","keywords":"GenAI HR Chatbot Q&A HR policies Automation"},{"title":"Phase 1: Optimizing Source Retrieval​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Optimizing Chatbot Performance: A Two-Phase Methodology for Enhanced Performance in HR Policy Responses","url":"blog/Wombat_HR#phase-1-optimizing-source-retrieval","content":" The first phase of our methodology was dedicated to optimizing the retrieval of relevant documents that the chatbot uses to generate answers. This phase is crucial as the quality of the final answer is directly influenced by the relevance of the retrieved sources. As shown in the &quot;Sources Retrieval Pipeline&quot; infographic, our process involves several key steps: Document Processing: Parsing PDF documents into raw contentCleaning and slicing the content using GPT-4Embedding the document chunks with OpenAI ADAIndexing the embeddings in a vector database Query Processing: Reformulating the user's question using GPT-4Retrieving relevant sources from the vector databaseIncorporating conversation history for context Key parameters we targeted for optimization included: k: The number of documents retrieved in response to a querymin_similarity: The minimum similarity threshold required for a source document to be considered relevant Process: We began by defining the parameters k and min_similarity, which directly impacted the chatbot’s ability to fetch the most relevant sources from the HR policy knowledge base. To optimize these parameters, we employed Optuna, a powerful hyperparameter optimization framework. The objective was to fine-tune k and min_similarity to maximize the relevance of retrieved documents, thereby setting a solid foundation for the subsequent answer generation phase. Here is the code snippet that demonstrates the optimization process: import mlflow import optuna import gc def objective(trial): with mlflow.start_run(nested=True): gc.collect() k = trial.suggest_int(&quot;k&quot;, 1, 4) min_similarity = trial.suggest_float(&quot;min_similarity&quot;, 0, 0.04) chunk_size = trial.suggest_int('chunk_size', 200, 2000) metrics = get_metrics(k, min_similarity, indexes_names_template='hr-dev-{chunk_size}') mlflow.log_params({&quot;k&quot;: k, &quot;min_similarity&quot;: min_similarity, &quot;chunk_size&quot;: chunk_size}) log_metrics(metrics) gc.collect() return -1*metrics['f1_score'] with mlflow.start_run(run_name=&quot;tuned_wombat_chatbot&quot;): study = optuna.create_study() study.optimize(objective, n_trials=200) best_params = study.best_params print(f&quot;best_params : {best_params} with final f_score of : {-1* study.best_value} on trial {study.best_trial}&quot;)  To create a realistic testbed, we engaged our Head of HR to formulate answers to 30 representative questions that the chatbot might encounter. These questions then served as our benchmark to systematically evaluate different configurations of k and min_similarity. By iterating through various combinations, we identified the optimal settings that resulted in the highest precision and recall rates during the retrieval process. "},{"title":"Phase 2: Fine-tuning Answer Generation​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Optimizing Chatbot Performance: A Two-Phase Methodology for Enhanced Performance in HR Policy Responses","url":"blog/Wombat_HR#phase-2-fine-tuning-answer-generation","content":" The second phase focused on refining the chatbot's ability to generate final answers that are not only accurate, but also contextually appropriate, based on the retrieved documents. Key components of this phase include: Question Reformulation: Using GPT-4 to enhance the original user questionSource Retrieval: Fetching the most relevant documents based on the reformulated questionAnswer Generation: Combining retrieved sources, conversation history, and the enhanced question to generate a final answer using GPT-4 Key focus areas for optimization included: Temperature: Controls the randomness of the language model’s predictionsPrompts: Customizable templates that guide the chatbot in generating responseschunk_size: Optimizing the size of text chunks processed by the system Process: With the retrieval pipeline optimized, the next step was to fine-tune the parameters governing the language model’s behavior during answer generation. We adjusted the temperature parameter to balance creativity with accuracy, ensuring that the chatbot's responses remained relevant without deviating from the core content of the HR policies. In addition to temperature, we experimented with different prompts that directed the chatbot on how to structure its responses. This step involved crafting and testing various prompt versions to determine which formulations yielded the most accurate and contextually aligned answers. Similar to the retrieval optimization, we used the same set of 30 HR-related questions and answers for evaluation. By comparing the chatbot's generated answers against the expected outcome, we employed a bespoke similarity metric to identify the most effective parameter configurations. These similarity metrics were computed by an external model called an LLM Judge that assessed the semantic similarity between the chatbot's responses and the expected answers. Answer Similarity Assessment This involved using a custom prompt to assess the semantic similarity between the chatbot's responses and the expected answers. By scoring this similarity and providing justifications, we gained additional insights into the chatbot's ability to produce responses that align closely with the intended content. Here is the prompt that we used for the similarity assessment! Task: You must return the following fields in your response in two lines, one below the other: score: Your numerical score for the model's answer_similarity based on the rubric justification: Your reasoning about the model's answer_similarity score You are an impartial judge. You will be given an input that was sent to a machine learning model, and you will be given an output that the model produced. You may also be given additional information that was used by the model to generate the output. Your task is to determine a numerical score called answer_similarity based on the input, output, and target. A definition of answer_similarity and a grading rubric are provided below. You must use the grading rubric to determine your score. You must also justify your score. Examples could be included below for reference. Make sure to use them as references and to understand them before completing the task. Input: {input} Output: {output} Target: {target} Metric definition: Answer similarity is evaluated on the degree of semantic similarity of the provided output to the provided targets, which is the ground truth. Scores can be assigned based on the gradual similarity in meaning and description to the provided targets, where a higher score indicates greater alignment between the provided output and provided targets. Grading rubric: Answer similarity: Below are the details for different scores: Score 1: The output has little to no semantic similarity to the provided targets.Score 2: The output displays partial semantic similarity to the provided targets on some aspects.Score 3: The output has moderate semantic similarity to the provided targets.Score 4: The output aligns with the provided targets in most aspects and has substantial semantic similarity.Score 5: The output closely aligns with the provided targets in all significant aspects. Examples: Example Input: What is MLflow? Example Output: MLflow is an open-source platform for managing machine learning workflows, including experiment tracking, model packaging, versioning, and deployment, simplifying the ML lifecycle. Example Target: MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning (ML) lifecycle. It was developed by Databricks, a company that specializes in big data and machine learning solutions. MLflow is designed to address the challenges that data scientists and machine learning engineers face when developing, training, and deploying machine learning models. Example score: 4 Example justification: The definition effectively explains what MLflow is, its purpose, and its developer. It could be more concise for a 5-score. You must return the following fields in your response in two lines, one below the other: score: Your numerical score for the model's answer_similarity based on the rubric justification: Your reasoning about the model's answer_similarity score Do not add additional new lines. Do not add any other fields. https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.metrics.html#mlflow.metrics.genai.answer_similarity Hyperparameter Optimization and Evaluation Both phases utilized Optuna for hyperparameter optimization, with a focus on minimizing the negative F1 score for improving the retrieval quality, and minimizing the negative similarity score of the final answer relevance. Throughout the optimization process, all relevant metrics and parameters were logged using MLflow, ensuring comprehensive tracking and enabling systematic comparisons between different experimental runs. Potential Biases and Limitations The obvious bias in the above process stems from the fact that the benchmark answers are written or vetted by a single individual, although this individual, as head of HR, has the final authority over what constitutes an acceptable answer. Nonetheless, any idiosyncrasies in how a single individual crafts sentences and structures answers are likely to have been picked up when computing similarity scores. Further, any development of chatbots for general usage will likely be optimized for sounding friendly and empathetic in a way that may transcend a single individual’s writing style. For instance, a user may expect interjections and exclamations such as “Congratulations” or “Commiserations” in output answers warranted by a given situation, which may deviate from sample answers that may be more factual. Our team had to balance such factors in their quest to achieve high similarity scores. Conclusion The methodology outlined here presents a robust, two-phase approach to optimizing a chatbot system designed to navigate the complex and sensitive domain of HR policies. By systematically refining both the source retrieval process and the answer generation mechanism, we have developed a chatbot that is both precise and contextually aware. The integration of advanced hyperparameter optimization techniques, combined with rigorous evaluation and tracking through MLflow, underscores the scientific rigor of this approach. As a result, the chatbot is well-equipped to deliver high-quality, relevant answers, enhancing user experience and ensuring that critical HR-related queries are addressed with the utmost accuracy. Finally, this approach holds relevance for topics that transcend HR – the methodology is just as applicable to building RAGs in any area or domain.

These two features provide the foundation for a stable and sustainable solution that provide for an unlimited and ever-growing number of users. Our method to industrialize data science solutions leverages three practices: DevOps – for continuous and shorter analytics deployment cycles, based on a scalable and governed infrastructure which is designed for technological solutions that will evolve over time.DataOps – for a bolstered data production chain, from the intake of raw data all the way to the production of business value.MLOps – to ensure that AI’s performance and costs are under control in order to address the business objective over the long run. Human-centered AI​ AI is not the solution, it’s a feature that if well designed can add unique value to solve real problems. Building a real data project requires interacting with experts, businesses &amp; customers and our approach ensures that humans are at the heart of the algorithmic creation process (UX design, simulations, trust design, active learning) At Ekimetrics we are careful to apply design thinking methodology to ensure the consistency of our product vision with end user needs. The success of a data-driven initiative is when it impacts operational processes, aligned with the company objectives, which requires the delivered solution to address the 3Us: Usable: integrated within the technical stack and connected with operational systems. Useful: understood by business users who are able to interpret and act upon the results and recommendations. Used: actually used by business users for decision making, and continuously improved to follow the business context and evolutions. Agile Data Science Framework​ Our approach in using an agile methodology allows this theory to be put into practice: Fast iterations: To proceed through iterative cycles interspersed with phases of re-prioritization of tasks, demos and user feedback, to approach final expectations as quickly as possible. User centric: To include end users from the very first phase of the project thanks to a design thinking approach to always identify the right problem and the right solution. Built for and by a team: To minimize silos in agile teams by constituting multidisciplinary and complementary teams and by establishing DevOps / DataOps practices. Prioritized by value and risk: Any task must be evaluated at each iteration on several axes: the risk incurred, the complexity, and the expected business value. Deprioritizing is not a taboo. Continuous improvements: Each iteration must allow the project to move forward and the teams to learn, by monitoring quality KPIs and by carrying out retrospectives on what worked and what didn't.","keywords":""},{"title":"Under the Hood: Technical Blueprint of a GenAI-Powered ESG Due Diligence Tool","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"blog/Under_The_Hood","content":"","keywords":"ESG Due diligence GenAI RAG Industrialised Software Operational excellence Automation Process standardisation"},{"title":"Model Details​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Under the Hood: Technical Blueprint of a GenAI-Powered ESG Due Diligence Tool","url":"blog/Under_The_Hood#model-details","content":" Vector Embeddings: Generated using OpenAI embedding model via Databricks.Chunking Strategy: Configurable chunk sizes with summarisation before embedding for efficient storage and retrieval.
