By means of activation functions and linear combinations of the input data, these networks introduce non linearities and become universal approximators [3]. The equation h(t+1) = f(ht, \u03b8t), captures the evolution of the hidden layers of a MLP network with ht referring to the previous layer and \u03b8t to a parameter of the network.
