Instead of modeling the true generative function of Y, we are looking to model its derivative. This article was seen as a major change in how we can shift from a discrete model state to a continuous one.\nLiquid Time Constant Networks (LTC) were introduced in 2020 with a strong emphasis on the concept of hidden state in the model. In previous models, hidden state at time t is optimized according to the output at time t (maximizing the accuracy). In LTCs, hidden state is used both to predict the output, but also the next hidden state t+1. It means that at each time-step, you update your memory, according to what you saw, see and expect to see in the future. This application is particularly powerful when you need to generate data at a given horizon. If you want a quick deep dive in LTC you can follow the first link.

The task consists in detecting in a picture multiple instances and drawing a bounding box around it. Back in 2015, the state-of-the-art architecture is a Region-based Convolutional Neural Network or RCNN (followed by different improvement called Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN\u2026). To make it brief and simple, RCNN takes Regions Of Interest (ROIs), which are little rectangle cropped from the image, fed to a Neural Network. Eventually ROIs are pooled together to produce the true bounding boxes we want.
