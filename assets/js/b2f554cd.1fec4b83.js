We also work on GCP and Cloud Dataflow, where Apache Beam provides the same flexibility to process streams as well as batches.\\n\\nBut IT teams ans Business teams are so used to batch analytics that it is hard to convey the value of real-time or up-to-date analytics, even though we now have platforms to handle the sources that can stream data. And with the emergence of micro-services, we also have more and more of these sources.\\n\\nBased on current market evolutions and on our previsions:\\n\\n- **Companies should create real-time views** of customers, products, suppliers and production plans on an easy-to-grow platform with the adequate governance,\\n- **Companies should assemble a real-time analytical view of their whole business** to be able to steer it appropriately,\\n\\nBecause this article is about real-time analytics, it starts with the definition of these terms. We use the example of driving a car as parallel for running a company. We all drive cars, we all see cars change, for example from \u201cmanual gearbox\u201d to \u201cautomatic gearbox\u201d to \u201cno more gearbox\u201d, and we all have a lot of knowledge about cars. Car technology will be used in this article to illustrate the following questions:\\n\\n- What is the minimal data available to drive a car and what is the benefit of additional data ?\\n- How to transpose for example the ABS of a car into a platform to help drive a company ?\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\nBelow are the steps in this article, as they will be presented and explained: \\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/level_car_analytics/Global_Table_1.png )\\n  \\n</div>\\n\\n<br/>\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Definitions\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nLet\u2019s first introduce definitions of the two topics of this article (independent of the car illustration):\\n\\n**Analytics**, as separated from **Operational**, is related to **data**:\\n\\n- **Operational data** is internal data from the business operations,\\n- **Analytical data** is operational data that is aligned, consolidated, reprocessed and possibly augmented with external data.\\n\\n <br/>\\n\\n**Real-time**, as separated from **Batch**, is related to **processing**:\\n\\n- **Batch processing** is about processing data on a schedule, between every few hours and every month. Users gets an image that is always a bit old, but for many businesses and operations this is seen as acceptable,\\n\\n- **Real-time processing** is about reflecting the current status of the operations. The latency depends of the source rather than the processing, it is between a few seconds and a few hours depending on the capability of the source system.\\n\\nWhen analyzing a business process, it is always a very interesting exercise to diagnose if a certain metric is operational or analytic. And if the data is analytic, the next question is to wonder if the business could benefit from having that metric in real-time.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n## Car-wise, let\u2019s start in the 1950s\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nI work in Paris, and tourists love to tour the city in Citro\xebn 2CV, a French car that was produced between the 50s and the 80s, like the picture below from one of the numerous companies renting these cars.\\n\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/level_car_analytics/Block_figures_1.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo electronics in there, this is pure mechanics and a few electrical wires, an ideal starting point for our journey !\\n\\nWhat data do you have to drive a Citro\xebn 2CV? Speed, battery level, gas levels, total mileage, that\u2019s it.\\nAnd the engine is so noisy that there is no need for an engine RPM meter !\\n\\nAccording to the definitions above, the data is the direct readings of the mechanical operations of the car, for example from the speed of the wheels, so this is operational data.\\n\\nNo further processing here, so no analytical data at all.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\nFinally, let\u2019s introduce this diagram of the car with no Analytics at all:\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/level_car_analytics/Diagram_1.png)\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n### How does driving a 2CV transpose to driving a company?\\n\\nWhen we transpose to driving a company, operational data is the data that resides in the operational systems, such a CRMs and ERPs. It contains all the referential and transactional information necessary to run the company, from HR to Sales to Finance. All reports and dashboards that are directly embedded in these applications or close to them are also considered operational data.\\n\\nSince there is enough information to run the business, we can jump to our first conclusion:\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/level_car_analytics/Diagram_2.png)\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n## Born in the 80s and mandatory in EU in 2003, the ABS\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nThe ABS, or Anti-lock Braking System, measures the speed of each wheel and reduces the pressure on the brakes to avoid the wheel locking up when losing grip.\\n\\nTo brake efficiently, it applies \u201cthreshold braking\u201d and \u201ccadence braking\u201d that are techniques of the most skillful drivers, taken here at a much faster rate than what these drivers can perform.\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/level_car_analytics/Diagram_3.png)\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n### What is real-time analytical processing of operational data in a business?\\n\\nIf we change the wheels of the cars by the BUs of a company, we get to a functional diagrams like the one below, where each BU includes efficient controls applied in real-time on the data from the operations:\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/level_car_analytics/Diagram_4.png)\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\nData Science is applied locally on the operational data, for purposes like segmentation, scoring, pricing and other applications of Machine Learning. The purpose here is to get value from investments in each BU, **but there are no insights to make the whole bigger than the sum of its parts.** It is like in the example of the ABS, we want to replicate the techniques of the best players, locally in each domain.\\n\\nIt is important to note that local AI initiatives do not require a dedicated platform for analytical data and that improving the operations locally can be achieved in the operational applications. For example, SAP and Salesforce include more and more predictive features. And since these platform work on up-to-date information, **embedding Machine Learning in operational systems is the closest to what ABS is in a car.**\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n## In 2014, the ESP becomes mandatory in all European cars\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nThe ESP (Electronic Stability Program) is an anti-skid system. It leverages four wheel-speed sensors, the steering angle sensor and an inertial measurement unit to act on the break pressure of each wheel and engine acceleration command. Depending on the situation, it can reduce the speed of the engine and brake all wheels or activate the brake on only one wheel only to alter the heading of the car.\\n\\nThe diagram changes, since all insights are now consolidated before they are processed:\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/level_car_analytics/Diagram_5.png)\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n### What does an ESP looks like in a company?\\n\\nIn your company, we are leaving the territory of ERPs, because even SAP does not cover all aspects that must be monitored and given sense together.  \\nIn addition, ERPs have many limitations regarding Advanced Analytics:\\n\\n- ERPs are complex to query and it may impact production,\\n- ERPs don\u2019t need and don\u2019t keep history,\\n- ERPs don\u2019t care about weak signals and don\u2019t make sense of unstructured data,\\n- ERPs are not designed to consolidate data with other ERPs or other operational platforms,\\n- And lastly, when a change is interesting, it takes ages to impact ERPs.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\nBecause consolidation cannot occur in the operational systems, **we introduce an additional data storage and processing layer called the analytical data plane** . We assemble data platforms that can host data assets of different Business Units, with some local autonomy and some global governance, so insights can be derived from many elements. This is where the Lakehouse and the Federated Governance patterns apply. \\n\\nThis is also where we believe we must now work in real-time, like in the ESP in the car analogy. The driving force is that **the analytical plane should be up-to-date with the data that is shared from the operational systems**, it should not add an hourly or a daily delay between the times it processes data.\\n\\nMost use-cases that we currently in batch will benefit from being executed with up-to-date data from the operations. Let\u2019s take a two examples:\\n\\n- The purpose of a Customer 360\xb0 use-case is to consolidate Transaction history, Social media presence, Customer support interactions, Segmentation history, Sensitivity to the promotions and prices, etc. into a single view of the customers. \\n\\n  Having that information always up-to-date could let you, for example:\\n  * Target, or restrain from targeting, in certain situations,\\n  * Send messages at the right moment,\\n  * Propose Next Best Action when the customer calls,\\n  * etc.\\n\\n- Expanding on that up-to-date Customer 360 and adding up-to-date supply-chain information and up-to-date suppliers information will enable new use-cases to better serve the customers needs.\\n\\n\\nIn addition to use cases, and if we consider a company as a complex system, **it is important to monitor all its moving parts together to better understand its reactions.** And when there are days or weeks between an action and the monitoring of its effect, it is more difficult to steer.\\n\\nFor these reasons, we want to propose real-time as the new standard, today: \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/level_car_analytics/Diagram_6.png)\\n\\n<br/>\\n</div>\\n\\n## Mandatory in 2022, AEB is the current state-of-the-art\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nIn addition to sensors that focus on the inside of the car, AEB (Automatic Emergency Braking) uses sensors that look outside of the car, like Front radar sensor, multi-purpose dashboard camera(s) and corner radar sensors. All these components embark object detection and tracking with deep neural networks and share their insights to a central unit that can act on the car brakes. \\n\\nThis is the most complex system that we study here and we can anticipate that the next step will be cars exchanging information together about conditions of the road. In the projects we currently participate in on connected cars, no data is currently shared between cars.\\n\\n\\nSo our last diagram is the most complete:\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/level_car_analytics/Diagram_7.png)\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n### Do you have AEB-like system in your company?\\n\\nAEB is about adding data sources to better anticipate market conditions, to better understand your customers, to better interact with your suppliers and your distributors, to gather data about your competitors, etc.\\n\\nAnd by now you have understood that in the context of the AEB, the purpose is to consolidate these insights in real-time and leverage these to take the best decisions.\\n\\nWhile buying or trading data is good, sharing data on platforms like Snowflake, BigQuery or Databricks Delta Sharing is better, because it is maintained in real-time by the other parties and you don\u2019t have to replicate it in batches.\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/level_car_analytics/Diagram_8.png)\\n\\n<br/>\\n</div>\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nWhile the focus of this article has been on the value of up-to-date analytics, we\u2019ll close this article with a preview of a next topic : the costs of the streaming datasets compared to traditional batch approaches.\\n\\nEkimetrics is investing a lot in making sure we manage the environmental aspects of the solutions we build, so this last point is critical! We currently work with Spark streams that have the .trigger(availableNow=True) option so they only process the newly arrived rows when the pipelines are executed every hour for example.  \\nSo that it remains cost- and emission- efficient.\\n\\n \\nAnd as a closing remark, as I was looking for the dashboards of the Renault 4L, Peugeot 205 and other 2CV, I found that in the latest small car from Citro\xebn, called the AMI, it is nearly as frugal as its predecessors ! \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/level_car_analytics/Block_figures_2.png)\\n\\nAnd it weighs only 500kg, which is frugal too.\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"/2023/02/28/building_datalake_part_2","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/02/28/building_datalake_part_2","source":"@site/blog/2023-02-28-building_datalake_part_2.md","title":"Building a datalake - Part 2 - Smart storage & computing strategies for better usability and usefulness","description":"For this second part of datalake building, we\u2019ll go deeper into the journey of data, more specifically expand on storage and compute strategies.","date":"2023-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 28, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Datalake","permalink":"/blog/tags/datalake"},{"label":"Data Engineering","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-engineering"},{"label":"Architecture","permalink":"/blog/tags/architecture"},{"label":"Data Governance","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-governance"},{"label":"Data Mesh","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-mesh"}],"readingTime":8.445,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Emilien BOUCAUD","title":"Data Engineering & Architecture Consultant","url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Building a datalake - Part 2 - Smart storage & computing strategies for better usability and usefulness","author":"Emilien BOUCAUD","author_title":"Data Engineering & Architecture Consultant","author_url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com","header_image_url":"img/blog/overview_datalake_part_2_v2.png","tags":["Datalake","Data Engineering","Architecture","Data Governance","Data Mesh"],"draft":false,"description":"For this second part of datalake building, we\u2019ll go deeper into the journey of data, more specifically expand on storage and compute strategies.","keywords":["Data Science","EkiLab","Ekimetrics","Eki.Lab","Eki","Machine Learning","Artificial Intelligence","Data Science for business","Datalake","Data Engineering","Lakehouse","Data Architecture","Data Governance","Data Validation","Data Mesh","Azure","AWS","GCP"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Does your company level with your car in terms of Analytics?","permalink":"/blog/2023/03/07/level_car_analytics"},"nextItem":{"title":"Exploring the links between creative execution and marketing effectiveness - Part V: Key Paths to Success and Common Pitfalls to Avoid","permalink":"/blog/2023/02/21/creative_execution_and_marketing_effectiveness_part_V"}},"content":"\x3c!-- import useBaseUrl from \\"@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\\";\\n\\n<link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"{useBaseUrl(\'katex/katex.min.css\')}\\" />\\n --\x3e\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/datalake_part_2/overview_datalake_part_2_v2.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n## Article Scope\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nIn a previous article - [Building a datalake - Part 1 - Usable, Useful, Used, or how to avoid dataswamp and empty shell traps | Eki.Lab](https://ekimetrics.github.io/blog/2022/02/07/building_datalake_part_1/) - we took a look at the foundation architecture used at Ekimetrics when building a datalake. Its focus was to present design elements to ensure your datalake is useful and usable at its core, as well as best practices to avoid falling into the so-called data swamp and empty shell traps.\\n\\nFor this second part, we\u2019ll go deeper into the journey of data, more specifically expand on storage and compute strategies, and see how the organisation of data and the way it is transformed impact a datalake\u2019s usability & usefuleness.\\n</div>\\n\\n## Introduction\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nThe overview of data\u2019s journey through a datalake or data platform can be broken down into five steps, represented below from left to right.\\n\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/datalake_part_2/img1_data_journey.png)\\n\\n  <div align=\\"center\\"> Data\u2019s journey, from source to usage\\n  </div>\\n  <br/>\\n\\nA data platform is highly versatile in providing technical options the five steps above. Getting your data from one step to the next means applying a strategy for how the data input is stored, how it is processed and how the output is exposed for the next step.\\n\\nThese strategies will vary depending on the use case and platform, taking business as well as technical constraints in consideration. Designing your datalake\u2019s strategies to be versatile and homogeneous is essential. It allows your data platform to grow fast, in terms of data content as well as use case possibilities. It also ensures that the datalake is under control with a common way of treating data, where its only varying specifities are the entry point (data sources) and output (serving layer). \\n\\nAt Ekimetrics, we\u2019ve developed versatile strategies that are applicable to most common use cases, easily reproducible. These strategies help build new capabilities and provide a better understanding of your data platform.\\n</div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n## Where designing storage & compute strategies really matters\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nIn most datalake architectures, the data journey\u2019s step where the most impactful design decisions can be made is _Data storage and processing_. The other steps are more straightforward:\\n\\n- Data sources are usually out of the architect or data engineer\u2019s control, as they often sit outside of the data platform (e.g. on a third-party server).\\n- Ingestion is a step for which design questions around data validation & organization processes may be worth considering. We\u2019ve talked about these processes in the first part of our \u201cBuilding a datalake\u201d articles. As for streaming vs batch, it is only dependent on the source: if the source system is streaming data, a resource to ingest that is necessary ; otherwise, recurrent batch ingestion is the go-to.\\n- Serving will depend on the target use case, so even if there are important design decisions to make, they will only be impactful in the scope of their use case, not for the whole datalake.\\n- Usage will most of the time be outside the datalake and depend on the use case. The few design decisions that may be necessary here won\u2019t be as impactful to the datalake\u2019s usability and usefulness either.\\n\\nOf course, this is not to say that designing relevant strategies and architecture for these steps doesn\u2019t matter: they must be tailored to the business case and technical constraints.\\n\\nOn the flipside, the _Data storage and processing_ step is the central piece in the datalake puzzle. It is where storage and compute strategies will be the most impactful. \\n\\nWhat could it look like, then ? Inside this central step, data transits through four zones, from its raw form to fully processed for a particular use case, ready to serve to your businesses. These four zones are detailed below, in between ingestion and serving.\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/datalake_part_2/img2_data_storage.png)\\n\\n  <div align=\\"center\\"> Data storage and processing - storage zones\\n  </div>\\n  <br/>\\n\\nThese zones can be found under various names: Landing - Bronze - Silver - Gold, or Temp - Raw - Cleaned - Conformed, etc. The intent is the same, where data becomes more and more usable and business use case oriented with each zone.\\n\\nIn between each storage zone, organization and transformation processes are applied to organize and extract insights out of data. This is where our storage and computing strategies come in.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n### Going from source to raw: storage strategy\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nAn ingested source will usually be exposed in one of two possible ways: \\n\\n- Incremental changes, where only what is new or updated is exposed.\\n- Full datasets, where all of the up-to-date data (or a new timeframe of data) is exposed.\\n\\nIn these two cases, the ingestion strategy we recommend results in the same outcome. Here the strategy is to historize all received data, adding metadata about its reception date (or validity date) through organization in the storage architecture or in the dataset itself. The RAW storage zone becomes a source of historical knowledge about all data points and their changes through time. Doing this, we\u2019re also able to add a \u201cslowly changing dimension\u201d / \u201cchange data capture\u201d aspect to our data, where we can easily find a data point\u2019s values at any moment in time.\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/datalake_part_2/img3_computing_1.png)\\n\\n  <div align=\\"center\\"> Fig. 1: Computing & storage strategies in between Landing and Raw zones\\n  </div>\\n  <br/>\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nThere are limitations to historizing all received data, notably storage costs: this is where the data\u2019s lifecycle must be discussed. Keeping all older versions of a single dataset may start to become expensive as the data piles up, outweighing the pros if only the latest values are used.\\n\\nIn this case, a solution can be to keep only the latest values of the source\u2019s data points, or just one version of the source every N periods on top of the latest ones. We can then archive older and unused versions in cold, less costly storage resources. The archived data enters a different lifecycle, where it could be removed at some point in the future if it doesn\u2019t serve any business purpose.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nThe \u201chistorize everything\u201d strategy ensures RAW storage is the most useful it can be: use case agnostic, your businesses can use and explore the data at its full potential. It also helps unify the way RAW storage is meant to be read by your later processes, improving usability while allowing for costs optimization without sacrificing the underlying principle.\\n\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Going from raw input to refined output: computing strategy\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nBy applying this highly inclusive storage strategy for our RAW storage, we\u2019re then able to fetch the necessary data for our business cases, whether it\u2019s using the full history of a source, its latest version or the latest changes only.\\n\\nThe most common computing strategy will be to generate an up-to-date view of the data: at the time of computing, what are the insights\u2019 state ? We\u2019re also able to use older data to track changes and generate insights from these.\\n\\nRefined data can then be exposed in two ways, acting as the source for another system: \\n\\n- Exposing the full dataset, where all data is up-to-date\\n- Exposing incremental changes, where only what is new or updated is sent to the serving layer\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/datalake_part_2/img4_computing_2.png)\\n\\n  <div align=\\"center\\"> Fig. 2: computing and storage strategies in between Raw, Trusted and Refined zones\\n  </div>\\n  <br/>\\n\\nFor some use cases, you can generate \u201cfrozen in time\u201d views of the data, only updating the current timeframe\u2019s view. For instance, we could update the current month\u2019s exposed insights each day, then stop updating it at the end of the month, writing a new one for the next month\u2019s computed insights, and so on.\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nHistorizing our transformations and results is useful for debugging and business exploration, but iterations may start to pile up, so defining a lifecycle for Trusted (TRD) and Refined (RFD) storage is important as well: do our technical processes or business use cases need all the iterations history stored in trusted TRD ? Can our business use cases work with a simplification of RFD storage, similar to the Delta historization for RAW zone in figure 1 ? \\n\\n:::\\n\\nYou may have noticed, our exposed Refined storage looks strangely similar to what we had in the data source: we\u2019re exposing either the full up-to-date version of our insights, or just updates and new ones, just like our sources. The datalake is now a source for your business\u2019 use cases, so it makes sense that it would be able to expose data in a similar way.\\n\\nThe \u201cup-to-date view\u201d strategy is highly useful for most use cases, and through smart use of historization, still allows for your businesses to get insights on the data\u2019s evolution through time.

Object Detection (OD) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) were used to detect specific features in creative images, such as faces, smiles, text, brand logos, etc. Then, in combination with impressions data, marketing mix models were used to investigate what objects, or combinations of objects in creative images in marketing campaigns, drive higher ROIs.\\nIn this last part we share with the reader common pitfalls to avoid when utilising tools for Object Detection, Optical Character Recognition and MMM, as well as things to keep in mind, that will facilitate the process.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n## Common Pitfalls to Avoid\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\n- **Failing to Define Labels at the Start:** Define the set of labels that are going to be studied at the very beginning. Adding more labels in the middle of the study would involve having to go back to time consuming tasks, such as manual labelling and repeated extraction and processing of labels.\\n\\n- **Ambiguous Object Definitions:** Describe clearly from the start what each label is (e.g., \u201cPerson\u201d can be any body part, not just a whole body with a face). This is helpful when the manual labelling is being done as a team, rather than by one person. Furthermore, if using a pre-trained model, ensure that your definition of the object aligns with what is detected by the model. For example, you may define \u201cCar\u201d as just the outside of the car while the OD model is trained to detect both the interior and exterior of cars.\\n\\n- **Non-Generalizable Labels:** If you are studying two separate sub-brands within one brand, it is advisable to have two separate studies, rather than one. That is, instead of defining objects \u201cBrand A Logo\u201d and \u201cBrand B Logo\u201d, it may be better to separate the brands into different streams and have the same object labels for both (e.g., logo, brand cue, product and person). This will ensure that you code is reusable for studies of brands that have different numbers of sub-brands.\\n\\n- **Lazy Manual Labelling:** Make sure to manually label all objects in a creative. For example, if there are three cars, label all of them, not just one. The manually labelled validation set is the ground truth against which a model\u2019s performance is compared. If some objects are missed, you may have strange performance results that indicate that the model may be over-detecting objects.\\n\\n- **Trying to be Exhaustive:** Avoid testing all open-source resources available, as this can be very time-consuming and not very fruitful. Choose two or three to test and instead spend more time on what you can do to improve their performance on your particular dataset. This could, for example, be done through hyperparameter tuning (e.g., testing different learning rates, batch sizes, confidence thresholds, etc.) or in the processing of the results (e.g., correcting any text labels inside logos or products).\\n\\n- **Lack of Checkpoints:** Due to the many different data manipulation steps in this project, there are a lot of potential sources for errors. The key is to set up automatic checks at each stage to avoid a trickle down effect of avoidable errors. For example, removing false positives in face detection by only \u2018accepting\u2019 a detected face if a person was also detected in the creative will ensure that the feature time series that is used for MMM does not suddenly have more impressions for faces than for people. Similarly, when doing the feature engineering, employing a simple method of checking that there are no negative values, no missing data, and that the impressions and spend data is consistent across each sub-model will ensure that time is not wasted in the MMM stage from modelling with incorrect data. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n## Key Paths to Success\\nThere are various components that can contribute to successfully executing this type of study, ranging from technical requirements to general strategies. Some of the key components are outlined below. \\n\\n### Integrated, Efficient Tools\\nChoosing the right tools can make or break a project of this complexity. Choose a platform which offers robust functionalities to help streamline and facilitate work. This study used Azure, but GCP is another great alternative. The key features that are required are:\\n- **Cloud storage:** Due to the volume of creatives included in this study, cloud storage was crucial. Particularly if extracting frames from videos, it is important to account for the significant volume of additional images that need to be stored. This project used Azure Storage. \\n- **Labelling Software:** The labelling process is very manual and time-consuming. Having an intuitive software that can import creatives directly from the cloud storage saves a lot of time and effort and avoids unnecessary duplication of images. Furthermore, the software should be able to export the labels as a JSON file which can then later be converted to the required format (e.g., COCO for Detectron2). For this project, the Azure Machine Learning Studio Data Labelling functionality was used. \\n- **External Computation Resources:** As the training, validation and final labelling of images are all computationally expensive processes, the use of external computation resources (clusters) is recommended. The configuration of the clusters can vary depending on the task at hand. For pre-processing and feature engineering, individual CPU-enabled single-node clusters are sufficient. On the other hand, for the training, validation, and labelling processes, it is recommended to use GPU-enabled clusters. While GPUs are a more expensive resources than CPUs, the efficiency gains may make up for the additional cost per hour. For this project, Databricks was used as it can connect to Azure storage, facilitates the use of clusters, supports various programming languages, and allows for collaboration on Notebooks.\\n\\n\\n### Contextual Knowledge\\nHaving a strong understanding of the brand acts as a crucial foundation for every step of this project. It is not only required for making informed decisions regarding which objects should be detected but also vital for defining the features to be measured in the MMM. For example, knowing that products often appear in creatives alongside just a hand raises the question of whether this is the most effective use of a person, or if including the person\u2019s face would be more effective; this in turn leads to the creation of features testing products alongside \u2018face-less\u2019 people vs. people with faces. Contextual knowledge can also be gained throughout the project by stopping to analyse the data. For example, checking the distributions of manually labelled objects can give an early indication of performance of custom-trained models (feasibility for successful training and detection) as well as the expected impact for regression models.\\n\\n### Strong Base Models\\nHaving strong base models is also key for success in this project. Since the target variable of the sub-models is determined by the contribution of the Meta variables in the base model, a poor base model will directly impact the performance of the sub-model. The quality of the base model will largely depend on the dataset used, so ensuring that sufficient, relevant, and good quality data relating to the baseline, market variations, and marketing activity is crucial. \\n\\n### Programmatic Sub-Modelling\\nDepending on the number of feature groups, KPIs and sub-brands included in the study, it may be infeasible to run the sub-models on a one-by-one basis. For context, this project had 156 sub-models (13 base models x 12 feature groups). For that reason, it is recommended to create a methodology that allows for the programmatic creation of sub-models. \\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"/2023/01/15/creative_execution_and_marketing_effectiveness_part_IV","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/01/15/creative_execution_and_marketing_effectiveness_part_IV","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-15-creative_execution_and_marketing_effectiveness_part_IV.md","title":"Exploring the links between creative execution and marketing effectiveness - Part IV: MMM for Creative Marketing Effectiveness","description":"In this Part IV we explore the MMM methodology applied.","date":"2023-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 15, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Object Detection","permalink":"/blog/tags/object-detection"},{"label":"Optical Character Recognition","permalink":"/blog/tags/optical-character-recognition"},{"label":"Marketing Mix Modelling","permalink":"/blog/tags/marketing-mix-modelling"},{"label":"Deep Learning","permalink":"/blog/tags/deep-learning"},{"label":"Tesseract","permalink":"/blog/tags/tesseract"}],"readingTime":5.09,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Marina Bermejo Sarmiento, Monica Brondholt Sorensen, Karin Sasaki","title":"Data Scientist Consultant","url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Exploring the links between creative execution and marketing effectiveness - Part IV: MMM for Creative Marketing Effectiveness","author":"Marina Bermejo Sarmiento, Monica Brondholt Sorensen, Karin Sasaki","author_title":"Data Scientist Consultant","author_url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com","header_image_url":"./img/blog/Eki_Meta_part_IV.png","tags":["Object Detection","Optical Character Recognition","Marketing Mix Modelling","Deep Learning","Tesseract"],"draft":false,"description":"In this Part IV we explore the MMM methodology applied.","keywords":["Data Science","EkiLab","Ekimetrics","Eki.Lab","Eki","Machine Learning","Artificial Intelligence","Data Science for business","Operational Research","Optimization","Knapsack problem","Deep Reinforcement Learning"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Exploring the links between creative execution and marketing effectiveness - Part V: Key Paths to Success and Common Pitfalls to Avoid","permalink":"/blog/2023/02/21/creative_execution_and_marketing_effectiveness_part_V"},"nextItem":{"title":"Exploring the links between creative execution and marketing effectiveness - Part III: Tesseract Pre-Trained Optical Character Recognition Models","permalink":"/blog/2022/12/13/creative_execution_and_marketing_effectiveness_part_III"}},"content":"\x3c!-- import useBaseUrl from \\"@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\\";\\n\\n<link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"{useBaseUrl(\'katex/katex.min.css\')}\\" />\\n --\x3e\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Eki_Meta/Eki_Meta_part_IV.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nThis article is **Part IV** of a set of five technical articles that accompany a [whitepaper](https://ekimetrics.com/news-and-events/exploring-the-links-between-creative-execution-and-marketing-effectiveness-exclusivepreview) written in collaboration between Meta and Ekimetrics.

Here you will learn that to improve accuracy in your measurement you must treat creatives differently. We provide the MMM methodlogy to reproduce this type of analysis for your brands.\\n \\n </div>\\n\\n\\n\\n## MMM Process\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nAn optimizsed two-staged modelling approach was applied to existing MMM models developed by Ekimetrics for a range of brands, products and KPIs. First, the base models were optimizsed, and second, sub-models were created to explain the variation in Meta contribution using the creative features. Bayesian optimization was used in both steps for variable transformation in relation to lag, adstock and saturation.\\n </div>\\n\\n <p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n ![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part4/1.png)\\n\\nModelling Workflow\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n## MMM Model\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nThe MMM models used in this analysis are multilinear regressions accounting for all significant factors driving the KPI (most commonly sales), including digital social. The selection of these models was based on the criteria of model stability (high R2, no autocorrelation, controlled heteroskedasticity) and enough variation in social activity (spend and impressions threshold of 5% per object). Some of the modelling periods were cut to account for sparse data, low correlation between creative impressions and modelled impressions or low variation. Therefore, a trusted relationship from social to the KPI of each MMM was established but could be enhanced by choosing more accurate parameterization of Meta activity through MMM model optimisation. Table 1 details the models included in the study. \\n </div>\\n\\n <p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n ![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part4/2.png)\\n\\nTable 1: Specifications of MMM models selected Detail of Models selected\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nOnce the MMM models were optimized, we isolated the impact of Meta on the KPI according to the following relationship:\\n <p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n***Meta Contribution to KPI = Coefficient of Meta Variable \xd7Transformed Meta Variable***\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\nThe Meta contribution became the dependent variable of the Sub-Model, along with the constant and residuals. The object detection impressions timeseries served as the explanatory variables. The objective of this was to understand the impact of different feature splits into the overall Meta performance, allowing room for movement through the constant and residuals. \\n\\nA sub-modelling approach allowed for the object detection features to have indirect effects on the KPI, through the Meta variable. Bayesian Optimisation Methods were employed to find the optimal transformations for each variable. \\n\\nEach Sub-model is a linear regression, testing the impact of the appearance of a feature, or feature group, and its opposite (partner feature) against the total Meta performance. Since the features are not mutually exclusive (between 48%-66% of creatives contained at least two objects), they could not all be tested in the same model. Furthermore, the daily impressions and spend per feature were split according to creative type. That is, the impressions associated with a feature or combination of features, e.g., Person & Product, were split out by static, video and carousel. While it was not in the scope of the study, doing this allowed for further analysis into the impact of features by creative type. \\n\\nA sequential approach was followed in which each feature group was tested in isolation. Within each sub-model, the transformations of the features (lag, adstock, and diminishing returns) which maximized R2, and minimized p-values were chosen. The transformations that the Meta features follow were bounded to the following ranges: lag of 0-3, adstock of 0-50, saturation (K; S) of 0.1-0.8; 1-9. \\n\\nAn example of sub-model is shown below.\\n\\n\\n ![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part4/9.png)\\n\\nWhere:\\n\\n<div align=\\"left\\">\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part4/10.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part4/11.png)\\n\\n\\nSame for Video (V) and Carousel (C)\\n\\nOne major challenge with the approach of testing the appearance of a feature or a set of features against its partner feature (e.g., impressions of creatives where a Brand Cue appears vs impressions of creatives where a Brand Cue does not appear), is that the partner feature is indirectly testing the appearance of other features or no features at all.\\nTo manage the risk of results inaccuracy we made sure that:\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n1. Both the main feature and the partner feature in the sub-models had to be statistically significant at a 10% level. For example, if the appearance of a feature is significant but the partner is not, the results of that regression were not used.\\n2. The percent of Impressions of the feature being tested had to be > 5%\\n\\n\\n## ROI Calculations\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nThe last step of the analysis centred around calculating ROIs and deriving ROI uplifts for each feature per brand, using the feature contributions from the sub-models and the associated spend. This involved the following steps:\\n\\n </div>\\n\\n1.\\tCalculate the ROI of each feature (and partnering feature/s) using the contribution and the spend associated with that feature.

Object Detection (OD) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) were used to detect specific features in creative images, such as faces, smiles, text, brand logos, etc. Then, in combination with impressions data, marketing mix models were used to investigate what objects, or combinations of objects in creative images in marketing campaigns, drive higher ROIs.\\nIn this Part III we explore the methodology for using Tesseract to detect text in creative images.\\n </div>\\n\\n## Detecting Text with Tesseract\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nTesseract is an open-source optical character recognition (OCR) Engine that allows for the recognition of text characters within a digital image. It is an open-source resource, originally developed by Hewlett-Packard, and now managed by Google. This package does not have any parameters to optimise, but, as is exposed here, the basic performance of this resource can be improved with a combination of image processing and detected text correction. \\n\\nIn this work, Tesseract was used to detect text in all images, in a process outlined in Figure 1. Performance of this detection tool was done using Confusion Matrices, to gain insight not only into the Accuracy, but also other metrics such as the True Positive and True Negative Rates.  \\n </div>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part3/10.PNG)\\n\\nFigure 1 - Three stage process by which the basic performance (accuracy) of Tesseract on the original images was improved by up to 28% points.\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nTo start with, the functionality was used on the original images to measure a baseline for performance on our sets of images. From this first step, we derived the following learnings:\\n\\n- For general Text (both non-promotional Text and Promotional Text), the Accuracy is 69%, the True Positive Rate is around 65%, the False Positive Rate is about 35%.\\n- Tesseract does not recognise symbols such as % (which may indicate promotional text) accurately.\\n- Tesseract does not perform well on images that have a busy background.\\n- Tesseract does not recognise slanted Text.\\n\\nBased on the low total volume of Promotional Text in our dataset, as well as the poor performance of Tesseract to detect Promotional Text, the decision was made to remove Promotional Text as one of the desired objects to study.\\n\\nBuilding on those learnings, we implemented a pipeline, outlined in Figure 2, that would help us improve the performance from baseline, by up to 28 percentage points on Accuracy : \\n </div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part3/11.PNG)\\n\\nFigure 2 - Pipeline for pre-processing images before Optical Character Recognition Models, and correcting detected text.\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nFor Step 1, pre-processing methods included the following, as well as combinations of those (illustrated in Figure 3): **Binary Threshold, Sharpen, Normalisation, Histogram Equalisation, Histogram Adaptive Equalisation**. As can be imagined, a processing method that enhances the performance of the detection method for one image, might decrease it for different images. Therefore, to ensure we obtained the highest accuracy for all images, we applied all pre-processing methods to all images, running Tesseract on each modified image, and keeping track of the text detected in each iteration. \\n </div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n ![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part3/12.PNG)\\n\\nFigure 3 - Effect of various image processing methods on the original.

Step 3 consisted of removing any \u201cincorrect\u201d text, such as text inside the bounding boxes of Logo or Product objects, if the text was shorter than a threshold length (which depended on the brand), if it consisted of keywords, such as the brand name, or if it had ASCII characters. \\n\\nWith the current methodology (figure 2), the accuracy cannot be improved any further by changing the length of text that is considered to be \u201ctrue\u201d Text. Furthermore, there is a trade-off between the True Negative Rate and the True Positive Rate, which helped us choose a threshold for the length of string to accept: Since Accuracy does not improve further after length 4, but this value does optimise the other two metrics, 4 characters long is the threshold chosen. \\n </div>\\n\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nThe performance of Tesseract may be improved further by adding another step to the pipeline in figure 2, where the image is rotated several degrees, and after each rotation, text is detected. Due to time constraint issues, and the fact that we had already achieved a significant improvement above baseline and reached an accuracy of high 90s for some of the brands, we did not implement this step.\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n## Code snippets\\n\\n### Install required libraries\\n\\n```\\n# To install tesseract\\n# !sh apt-get -f -y install tesseract-ocr \\n!sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr -y\\n\\n# To install pytesseract\\n!pip3 install pytesseract\\n```\\n\\n### Import required libraries\\n\\n```\\nimport pytesseract\\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score\\nimport cv2\\nfrom PIL import Image\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Processing images\\n\\n```\\ndef normalise_img(image):\\n            \\n    # normalise original and detect\\n    norm_img = np.zeros((image.shape[0], image.shape[1]))\\n    normalised = cv2.normalize(image, norm_img, 0, 255, cv2.NORM_MINMAX)\\n    normalised = cv2.threshold(normalised, 100, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)[1]\\n    normalised = cv2.GaussianBlur(normalised, (1, 1), 0)\\n    \\n    return normalised\\n```\\n\\n```\\ndef threshold_image(image, threshold=200):\\n    image = cv2.threshold(image, threshold, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)[1]\\n    return image\\n```   \\n    \\n```    \\ndef remove_noise_and_smooth(image):\\n\\n    # convert to grayscale\\n    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\\n\\n    # blur\\n    blur = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (0,0), sigmaX=33, sigmaY=33)\\n\\n    # divide\\n    divide = cv2.divide(gray, blur, scale=255)\\n\\n    # otsu threshold\\n    thresh = cv2.threshold(divide, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY+cv2.THRESH_OTSU)[1]\\n\\n    # apply morphology\\n    kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_RECT, (3,3))\\n    morph = cv2.morphologyEx(thresh, cv2.MORPH_CLOSE, kernel)\\n\\n    return morph\\n```\\n\\n```\\ndef im_to_gray(image):\\n    # convert to grayscale \\n    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\\n    return gray\\n ```\\n\\n```   \\ndef create_binary(image):\\n    # create binary -

Object Detection (OD) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) were used to detect specific features in creative images, such as faces, smiles, text, brand logos, etc. Then, in combination with impressions data, marketing mix models were used to investigate what objects, or combinations of objects in creative images in marketing campaigns, drive higher ROIs.\\nIn this Part II we explore the methodology for training Detectron2 models to detect brand-specific object in creative images.\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n## Why you should read this\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nThis article is mostly directed to machine learning practitioners. Here you will find a practical application of object detection algorithms; we present different open-source resources, comparisons and trade-offs in model selection for specific objects, methodology to improve performance for custom datasets, and how the object detection is then used to make inferences on the impact of creatives in marketing strategies.  \\n </div>\\n\\n\\n\\n## Dataset\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nOur dataset contained >50k image and video creatives across four different brands. The main goal of the custom object detection (OD) was to detect three types of brand-specific objects - logo, product and brand cue - as well as faces and smiles. Initially, faces and smiles were detected by pre-trained algorithms such as Haar cascades and Dlib, but due to the poor performance, it was decided to use a custom algorithm. \\n\\nBefore beginning the OD process, videos were converted to images by extracting every tenth frame. Training and Validation sets were then created using the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio labelling tool. The labels were then converted to COCO format, and registered in Detectron as custom COCO libraries. Read more about this in [Part I](https://ekimetrics.github.io/blog/2022/11/10/creative_execution_and_marketing_effectiveness_part_I). \\n\\n```\\n## Registering COCO format datasets\\nfrom detectron2.data.datasets import register_coco_instances\\n\\nregister_coco_instances(train, {\'thing_classes\': train_metadata.thing_classes, \'thing_dataset_id_to_contiguous_id\': train_metadata.thing_dataset_id_to_contiguous_id}, train_json_path, TRAINING_IMAGES_PATH)\\nregister_coco_instances(valid, {\'thing_classes\': valid_metadata.thing_classes, \'thing_dataset_id_to_contiguous_id\': valid_metadata.thing_dataset_id_to_contiguous_id}, valid_json_path, VALID_IMAGES_PATH)\\n```\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n## Algorithm\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nThe Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) model, Faster R-CNN X 101 32x8d FPN 3x, was used for the custom OD model.  \\n\\nOne model was trained per object per brand using the manually labelled training sets. For detecting faces and smiles, the training set consisted of creatives from all four brands, but each model was developed separately for face and smile per brand. In total there were, thus, 19 custom models. The validation set was used to tune hyperparameters of each model, with accuracy as the main metric. The final models were then used to detect objects in the unlabelled images for all four brands. The training, validation and final detections were all done using a single node GPU (CUDA) on Databricks.\\n </div>\\n\\n## Hyperparameter Tuning\\n### Process \\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nWhile Detectron2 allows for the customization of many configurations, including learning rate, backbone, image size, and number of images per batch, we limited the scope to just three parameters due to time constraints. These are summarized in Table 1 along with the parameter values tested. The choice of parameters was based on those deemed to be the most influential in performance. In addition to these parameters, the learning rate \u2013 the rate at which the algorithm converges to a solution   \u2013 was customized.  Rather than using the default value of 0.001, the learning rate was determined by the linear learning rate scaling rule. This was done in order to facilitate training on larger batch sizes.\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n <p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n ![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part2/1.png)\\n\\nTable 1: Parameters Tested in Custom Models\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExample Code\\n```\\n## Parameters values to test\\nparameters = {\\n    \'SOLVER.MAX_ITER\': [300, 500, 1000],\\n    \'ROI_HEADS.BATCH_SIZE_PER_IMAGE\': [265, 512, 1024]\\n}\\n\\n## Configuring the algorithmn\\ndef config_detectron(train_dataset, max_iter, batchsize):\\n    classes = MetadataCatalog.get(train_dataset).thing_classes\\n    num_classes = len(classes)\\n    print(f\\"Number of classes in dataset: {num_classes}\\")\\n    cfg = get_cfg()\\n    cfg.merge_from_file(model_zoo.get_config_file(\\"COCO-Detection/faster_rcnn_X_101_32x8d_FPN_3x.yaml\\"))\\n    cfg.DATASETS.TRAIN = (train_dataset, )\\n    cfg.DATASETS.TEST = ()\\n    cfg.DATALOADER.NUM_WORKERS = 0\\n    cfg.MODEL.WEIGHTS = model_zoo.get_checkpoint_url(\\"COCO-Detection/faster_rcnn_X_101_32x8d_FPN_3x.yaml\\") # Let training initialize from model zoo\\n    cfg.SOLVER.IMS_PER_BATCH = 2 ## # How many images per batch?

Object Detection (OD) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) were used to detect specific features in creative images, such as faces, smiles, text, brand logos, etc. Then, in combination with impressions data, marketing mix models were used to investigate what objects, or combinations of objects in creative images in marketing campaigns, drive higher ROIs.\\nIn this Part I we explore the methodology for using pre-trained Detectron2 models to detect brand-specific object in creative images.\\n\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n\x3c!-- import useBaseUrl from \\"@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\\";\\n\\n<link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"{useBaseUrl(\'katex/katex.min.css\')}\\" />\\n --\x3e\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## Why you should read this\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nThis article is primarily directed to machine learning practitioners. Here you will find a practical application of object detection algorithms. We present different open-source resources, comparisons and trade-offs in model selection for specific objects, and methodology to improve performance for custom data sets.\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n\\n## Manual labeling of the Training and Validation data sets\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nIn order to train custom train models (Part II of these series), as well as to evaluate the performance of all models, a proportion of the images were manually labeled in the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio labeling tool. The tool facilitates the interactive selection of the region of interest, and the labeling of said region with a pre-defined object label, as shown in Figure 1. \\n\\n </div>\\n\\n <p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/1.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 1 - Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio Image labeling Tool. Source: Microsoft.\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nBefore undertaking the task of manually labeling images, and specially if it is done by a team of people and not a single person, it is advisable to have a pre-defined set of rules on how to approach the task. For example: when labeling \u201cPerson\u201d, will you label only whole people? Or would you also label body parts as \\"Person\\"? Or at least those that show a face? - It is also important to ensure that all relevant objects in an image are labeled, specially in the validation data set, since that will constitute the ground truth when it comes to evaluating the performance of Object Detection models. When this is not done carefully, it becomes a problem, as some OD models might actually detect more objects than those which have been manually labeled.\\n\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n#### Distribution of Objects in Manually labeled Data set and Implications for the labeling of the Unlabeled Data set\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nThe train, validation and unlabeled data sets were created by taking random samples of all the creatives. This strategy generated a training and validation set that have very close matching distributions of the labels of interest, as shown in Figure 2. Therefore, we assessed that it is likely that the performance of the models (pre-trained or custom) on the validation data sets will be transferable to the unlabeled data sets.\\n\\n </div>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/2_v3.png)\\n\\nFigure 2 - The distribution of labeled objects in the Train (outer) and Validation (inner) data sets.\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n## Models\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nThe object detection process relied on a combination of pre-trained and custom-trained models from two Python libraries: Tesseract and Detectron2. Tesseract, an open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) library, was used for detecting text, while Detectron2, Facebook AI Research\'s next-generation platform for object detection and segmentation, was used for the remaining objects. We will explore the details of Tesseract in Part III of this series. From Detectron2, pre-trained object detection models were used for detecting common objects such as people, cars, and technology, while custom-trained models were used for detecting brand-specific objects such as logos (see Part II). Figure 3 outlines the objects detected by each model type.\\n\\n </div>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/3.png)\\n\\nFigure 3 - Object Detection using different pre-trained and custom-trained models.\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n### Pre-Trained Models\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nPre-trained Detectron2 models are trained on the Microsoft COCO (Common Objects in Context) data set [1]; a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning data set popularly used for computer vision projects. It contains over 200k labeled images, across 80 object categories (person, car, etc.) and 90 \\"stuff\\" (sky, grass, etc.) categories. However, for this study, we focused only on the detection of objects relating to the features of interest, detailed in figure 4. \\n\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/4.png)\\n\\nFigure 4 - COCO Objects Detected in Pre-Trained Models, Present in Creatives of Brands Studied\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n \\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n### Choosing a Detectron2 Pre-Trained Model\\nThe performance on Accuracy and Confidence Score (see figure 5 - Definition Box 1) were compared for three models : \\n\\n- Model 1: Faster R-CNN R50 FPN 1x \\n\\n- Model 2: Faster R-CNN R101 FPN 3x\\n\\n- Model 3: Faster R-CNN X 101 32x8d FPN 3x \\n\\nOverall, Model 3 has the highest average Accuracy while Model 2 has the highest average Confidence Score. The number of creatives with correctly identified objects is highest in Model 3. Figure 6 shows the results. \\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/5.png)\\n\\nFigure 5 - Definition Box 1\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n\\nMore in detail, for each object type: \\n- People: All three models have varying performance in detecting people across different brands. Overall, Model 3 has the highest accuracy.\\n- Technology: Model 2 is most confident in detecting tech, but misses tech in many creatives entirely. Overall, Model 3 has the highest accuracy.\\n- Cars: Model 3 has the highest average confidence and accuracy in detecting cars.\\n- Hotel Interiors and Food: Model 2 and Model 3 have a similar performance in detecting food and interior, both higher than Model 1.\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/6.png)\\n\\n Figure 6 - Comparison in performance on the validation data set of three pre-trained Detectron2 models.\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nFurthermore, Model 3 overcomes challenges faced by the other two models, such as identifying people in close-up shots, identifying cars from interior shots, and identifying technology when in a person\u2019s hand or lying on a table. \\n\\nFigures 7 and 8 show the performance of Model 3 on the specific Objects of interest. In particular, the Confidence Scores (figure 8) that lead to the high Accuracies in figure 7 range from between 80% to 98%. As we developed our methodology to be applicable regardless of the industry, we needed to choose a Confidence Score Threshold of Acceptance that is high enough to ensure accuracy, but not too high that it would miss objects of interest entirely. Therefore, a threshold of 85% confidence was selected.\\n\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/7.PNG)\\n\\nFigure 7 - Accuracy of Faster R-CNN X 101 32x8d FPN 3x on Specific Object Types.\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/8.PNG)\\n\\nFigure 8 - Average Confidence of Faster R-CNN X 101 32x8d FPN 3x on Specific Object Types.\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nFinally, since our creatives comprise of both still images, as well as frames extracted from video files, we wanted to make sure Object Detection was accurate in both types of images. Figure 9 shows the performance of Faster R-CNN X 101 32x8d FPN 3x (Model 3). The confidence scores do not differ significantly between frames and still images (at most 1.4% points). This means that the model can recognise object of interest with equal confidence in both types of images. The differences in performance may be attributed to people in frames more often being close-up; cartoons appear in frames while they are absent in stills; and frames of cars over-index on close-up shots and interior shots.\\nThe total detection time for all brands ranged 210 hours.\\n </div>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/9.PNG)\\n\\nFigure 9 - Performance of Faster R-CNN X 101 32x8d FPN 3x on Still vs Frame images.\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n### Useful links\\n- [Detectron2 - Github](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)\\n- [Detectron2 - Documentation](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\\n- [Detectron2 - ModelZoo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/main/MODEL_ZOO.md)\\n\\n## Snippets of code\\n\\n\\n\\n### Installations\\n\\n```\\n!pip install detectron2 -f https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detectron2/wheels/$CUDA_VERSION/torch$TORCH_VERSION/index.html\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Import libraries\\n```\\nimport detectron2\\nfrom detectron2.engine import DefaultPredictor\\nfrom detectron2.config import get_cfg\\nfrom detectron2.data import MetadataCatalog, data setCatalog\\nfrom detectron2.utils.visualizer import ColorMode, Visualizer\\nfrom detectron2 import model_zoo\\nfrom detectron2.evaluation import COCOEvaluator, inference_on_data set\\nfrom detectron2.data import build_detection_test_loader\\n\\nfrom PIL import Image\\nimport cv2\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Define detector class\\n```\\nclass Detector:\\n    \\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.cfg = get_cfg()\\n        \\n        #

Stay tuned! \\n\\n## Appendix \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Resources\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nAn Azure Resource Group was set up in order to manage the Storage, Code Development and Machine Learning Studio functionalities. All the data was stored in Azure Storage. All code to process images, and implement Object Detection was written in Python scripts, in Azure Databricks notebooks. labeling of images was done in Azure Machine Learning Studio.\\nCustom-trained models were trained and validated, and the unlabeled data set was labeled using the chosen models (both pre-trained and custom-trained), in a GPU cluster (Databricks Runtime Version 9.1 LTS ML includes Apache Spark 3.1.2, GPU, Scala 2.12 with Node Type Standard_NC_12 112 GB memory and 2 GPUs). Images were funnelled through the models in chunks of 200 images.\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n### Detectron2\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nDetectron2 is a Facebook AI Research (FAIR) open-source library that provides object detection and segmentation algorithms [2-5]. It is implemented in PyTorch, and includes state-of-the-art algorithms like RetinaNet, Mask R-CNN, TensorMark and Faster R-CNN. Its training pipeline is GPU-run, making it fast and highly scalable. Furthermore, its modular nature allows for custom models to be created within an existing object detection framework. As a result, it was more suited for the needs of this study than other common object detection libraries like Yolov4. \\n\\nFor both the pre-trained and custom models, a Faster R-CNN algorithm was used due to its speed and high performance on small object detection. This algorithm combines two network models: Fast R-CNN (Region based Convolutional Neural Network), a deep learning algorithm which generates a convolutional feature map, and RPN (Regi on Proposal Networks), a convolutional network that proposes regions. \\n\\nThe specific model used was Faster R-CNN X 101 32x8d FPN 3x, a Faster R-CNN model developed by Detectron2 which uses a FPN (Feature Pyramid Networks) backbone, and a learning rate schedule of 3x. This model was chosen based on the baseline performances reported by FAIR, which highlight this model as having the highest average precision and training memory. For more information. Furthermore, the model was tested and evaluated against the performance of other Faster R-CNN models on objects the models are pre-trained on, against out Validation set.  Figure 6 shows the results.\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n\\n### Manipulating Bounding Boxes\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nDifferent technologies (Azure, Detectron2, Tesseract) have different formats when it comes to annotating the bounding boxes [6]. Therefore, it was necessary to manipulate the bounding boxes as follows (figure 10):\\n\\nIn order to train the Custom-Trained Models, the Azure format was converted to the Detectron2 format: COCO bounding box (bbox) is defined as [x_min, y_min, width, height]. \\n\\nJSON files exported from Azure Data labeling have bounding boxes that are normalised. Detectron2 expect the bounding boxes in absolute values. Therefore, we transformed the attribute \'bbox\' of the COCO file downloaded from Azure ML Studio to denormalise it, and added the \'bbox_mode\' attribute to be equal to 1 (XYWH_ABS 0). We also add the pair \\"iscrowd:0\\" to each annotation [8].\\n\\nIn order to limit the region in images for text detection to outside of Logo and Product objects, Detectron2 format was transformed to Tesseract format: Detectron2 format [X, Y, W, H] to the Tesseract format (x1=X, x2=W+X, y1=Y, y2=H+Y).\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/14.PNG)\\n\\nFigure 10 - Manipulation of bounding boxes to accommodate each technology.

The second transformation was necessary to limit the region in images for text detection to anything outside of logo or product objects.\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n### Detecting Faces with Open libraries with Pre-Trained Models \\nTo detect Faces and Smiles, we began by exploring open libraries that have pre-trained models for this purpose. Figure 11 shows some of the libraries available, as well as those we tested.\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/15.PNG)\\n\\nFigure 11 - Open libraries with pre-trained models that detect faces and smiles, and those we tested.\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nWe tested three different open libraries that are optimised for face detection. The Haar Cascades model has two parameters that need to be optimised, so we set up two sets of 52 experiments to find the optimum models that detect Faces and Smiles. Visually, it was clear that the models had a very high rate of False Positives, therefore we enhanced the detection algorithm by limiting the detection zone for smiles to be only inside the bounding boxes of faces, as shown in figure 12. \\n </div>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/16.PNG)\\n\\nFigure 12 - Smiles being detected inside faces only was a necessary methodology we implemented, to improve the accuracy of open libraries that detect faces and smiles.\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nFurthermore, as there were no ready-made functions in the libraries to assess the performance of predictions, we developed a method that compared the intersection of the bounding boxes between of the manually labeled and predicted objects, as shown in figure 13. All the models tested suffered from having a high False Positive Rate. The best performing model was with library DLIB, with an Accuracy of 59%, a True Positive Rate of 41% and a False Positive Rate of 36%. Therefore, we needed a better methodology for detecting Faces and Smiles, so we tested training a custom Detectron2 model to do so, as described in Part III of this series. \\n </div>\\n\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/17.PNG)\\n\\nFigure 13 - Methodology for assessing whether a predicted label for Face or Smile is accurate.

We show that the attention coefficients specific to BERT architecture constitute a particularly rich piece of information that can be used to perform interpretability. There are mainly two ways to do interpretability: attribution and generation of counterfactual examples. In a first article, we showed how attention coefficients could be the basis of an attribution interpretability method. Here we propose to evaluate how they can also be used to set up counterfactuals. \\n</div>\\n\\n\\n <div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\n## Work presented in the previous article\\n\\nPreviously, the BERT [1] and DistilBERT [2] models have been mobilized to tackle the well-known problem of sentiment analysis. In particular, we have shown that the BERT and DistilBERT models contain within their architecture attention coefficients that can be at the heart of an attribution interpretability method. Starting from an initial text, a visualization of the weight assignment method was proposed. The more red the color, the higher the associated attention coefficient. \\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n ![screenshot-app](img/Interpretability_sentiment_analysis/Part_II/Image_2.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 1 - Attention-Based token importance\\n</div>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n We saw that the word groups \\"_favorite movie_\\", \\"_it just never gets old_\\", \\"_performance brings tears_\\", or \\"_it is believable and startling_\\" stood out. This explained well why the algorithm evaluated the review as positive and what was the semantic field at the root of this prediction. This work was done using the Hugging Face transformers library [3].\\n\\n## Interpreting through counterfactual generation\\n\\nAnother way to do interpretability is to generate counterfactual examples. According to Judea Pearl, counterfactual \\"involves answering questions which ask what might have been, had circumstances been different\u201d [4]. Thus, the idea is to understand a prediction by generating a counterfactual example, resulting in an opposite prediction. In the context of natural language processing, it is therefore a matter of changing the right words in the review. In order to generate a counterfactual example, we propose the following methodology:\\n- Compute the attention coefficients of the tokens in a text corpus on each attention layer (6). The text corpus size must be statistically significant \\n- Perform token clustering based on their 6-dimensional representation\\n- Detect clusters associated with positively and negatively charged sentiment words\\n- Replace the tokens with the highest average attention with their \\"opposite token\\" in their \\"opposite cluster\\"\\nThis approach allows us to validate the interpretative strength of the tokens put forward by the attention coefficients, while illustrating what a close review would have been with an opposite sentiment. \\nWe apply the methodology on a corpus of 1000 reviews. The clustering method used is the hierarchical ascending classification (HAC) and gives 3 clusters. The obtained clusters and the counterfactual generation procedure can be represented in 2 dimensions as follows:\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n ![screenshot-app](img/Interpretability_sentiment_analysis/Part_II/Image_3.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 2 - Token clusters & replacements\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe then generate the counterfactual example of the review tested earlier by changing 2 words: \\n\\n\\n <div align=\\"center\\"> \\ndelight \u27a1 torment\\n\\nfavorite \u27a1 worst\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nThis gives us the following counterfactual example:\\n\\n\u201c_Probably my all time worst movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause but its not preachy or boring . it just never gets old despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years . paul lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a torment. the kids are as grandma says more like dressedup midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch . and the mothers slow awakening to whats happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling . if i had a dozen thumbs they\u2019d all be up for this movie_\\".\\n\\nAs the text is quite long, 2 tokens are not enough to change the feeling associated with the review. The probability score nevertheless drops significantly by 0.3pts.\\nOne way to assess the quality of the generated counterfactual examples is to evaluate the proportion of reviews in a corpus whose associated sentiment has changed. The result can be represented as a \\"counterfactual confusion matrix\\" as follows:\\n\\n\\nOne way to assess the quality of the generated counterfactual examples is to evaluate the proportion of reviews in a corpus whose associated sentiment has changed. The result can be represented as a \\"counterfactual confusion matrix\\" as follows:\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n ![screenshot-app](img/Interpretability_sentiment_analysis/Part_II/Image_4.jpg)\\n\\nTable 1 - Counterfactual confusion matrix example\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere :\\n- X<sub>11</sub> represents the share of reviews whose initial associated sentiment and the sentiment of the counterfactual example are positive; sentiment has remained the same \\n- X<sub>12</sub> represents the share of reviews whose sentiment changed from positive to negative; sentiment did change \\n- X<sub>21</sub> represents the share of reviews whose sentiment changed from negative to positive; sentiment changed well\\n- X<sub>22</sub> represents the share of reviews whose initial associated sentiment and the sentiment of the counterfactual example are negative; sentiment has remained the same\\n\\nWe compute the \\"counterfactual confusion matrix\\" on the same text corpus that enabled us to perform clustering, picking 5 tokens for each review. The result is given below:\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n ![screenshot-app](img/Interpretability_sentiment_analysis/Part_II/Image_5.jpg)\\n\\nTable 2 - Actual counterfactual confusion matrix\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n <p>&nbsp;</p>\\nThus, we see that changing the 5 tokens with the highest average attention produces a change in sentiment perception in 44% of cases. In particular, the rate of sentiment change for reviews initially perceived as positive is 31% while the rate of sentiment change for reviews initially perceived as negative is 53%. The change from negative to positive seems to be better achieved with our method.\\n\\nWe have shown that attention coefficients can be a source of interpretability. Used in the right way, the attention coefficients allow the detection of tokens with high predictive value. They can also be used to generate counterfactual examples in order to better understand what the sentence should have been in order to be associated with an opposite sentiment. The interest of the attention coefficients is reinforced by the \\"counterfactual confusion matrix\\": The high transformation rate of the reviews\' sentiments shows that the tokens selected thanks to the attention are strongly meaningful.\\n\\n## Next step\\nWe plan to test other ways to generate counterfactual examples. One way would be to take advantage of the way DistilBert has been trained: the mask language modeling (MLM). The idea would be to mask the tokens with high average attention, and replace them with the tokens with the highest softmax in the \\"opposite cluster\\". This would ensure the grammatical correctness of the generated counterfactual example. Finally, the generation of counterfactual examples can have other applications than interpretability. In particular, it becomes possible to perform data augmentation in order to give more examples to a model. It can mitigate biases by balancing the sentiments of biased discriminated populations. This would improve fairness indicators while not degrading accuracy. \\n\\n## References\\n[1] VASWANI, Ashish, SHAZEER, Noam, PARMAR, Niki, et al. Attention is all you need.

There are mainly two ways to do interpretability: attribution and generation of counterfactual examples. Here we propose to evaluate how attention coefficients can form the basis of an attribution method. We will show in a second article how they can also be used to set up counterfactuals. \\n</div>\\n\\n\\n## The BERT architecture\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nAn artificial neural network is a computer system inspired by the functioning of the human brain and biological neurons to learn specific tasks. The neural networks represent a subset of machine learning algorithms. In order to perform a learning task, the neural network spreads information through an elementary network, called a perceptron. The way in which information is diffused can be formalized through linear algebra and the manipulation of various activation functions. A neural network can be defined as an association of elementary objects called formal neurons, like the perceptron. There are several types of layers that can be part of a neural network:\\n\\n- Fully connected layers, which receive a vector as input, and produce a new vector as output by applying a linear combination and possibly an activation function;\\n- Convolution layers, which learn localized patterns in space;\\n- Attention layers, which model the general relations between different objects.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nAttention mechanisms are particularly effective for natural language processing tasks. This is mainly due to the fact that they allow to properly model a word through mathematical representations. In particular, attention layers make it possible to assign a contextual representation of the word on a case-by-case basis. This makes it a much more efficient tool than Word2vec since the latter only models an average context, but does not adapt to the given situation. Attention mechanisms are at the heart of Transformers-type models as shown in the diagram below. The BERT model corresponds to a stack of the left part of the generic architecture of a Transformer [1].\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Interpretability_sentiment_analysis/part_I/Image_2.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 1 - Transformers architecture\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n ## Fine tuning of BERT for sentiment analysis\\n\\n <div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nTo illustrate how attention coefficients can be a source of interpretability in natural language processing, we propose to fine tune a DistilBERT for sentiment analysis. A DistilBERT is a distilled version of BERT. It is smaller, faster, cheaper, lighter and recovers 97% of BERT\u2019s performance on GLUE [2]. A perfect compromise, in fact. Most transformers are available pre-trained on the Hugging Face transformers library [3]. The objective is to perform supervised classification on the IMDB database to assess the sentiment associated with a movie review. An illustration of the dataset is shown below:\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Interpretability_sentiment_analysis/part_I/Image_3.jpg)\\n\\n Figure 2 - IMDB sample\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n To do so, we import all the libraries needed.  In particular, the tokenizer DistilBertTokenizer and the pre-trained hugging face model TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification are used.\\n\\n ```\\ntokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained(\'distilbert-base-uncased\')\\nsentence_encoder = TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\'distilbert-base-uncased\', output_attentions = True)\\n```\\n\\n\\nThe parameter \\"output_attention\\" must be equal to \\"True\\". It will allow us to retrieve the attention coefficients of the model. We add a dense layer with a softmax activation to fine tune the model to do sentiment analysis. In order to train the model, we use the following hyperparameters:\\n\\n- initial_lr  = 1e-5\\n- n_epochs    = 15\\n- batch_size  = 64\\n- random_seed = 42\\n\\nFinally, we make evolve the learning and stop the learning process if the val_loss does not decrease after a certain number of iterations. \\n\\n```\\nreduce_lr = ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor=\'val_loss\', factor=0.2, verbose = 1,min_delta=0.005,patience=3, min_lr=3e-7)\\n\\nearly_stop = EarlyStopping(monitor=\'val_loss\', min_delta=0, patience=6, verbose=1, mode=\'auto\',baseline=None, restore_best_weights=True)\\n```\\n\\nWe can finally fine tune the DistilBert.\\n```\\nhistory = model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=bs, epochs=n_epochs, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), \\n                    verbose=1,callbacks=[early_stop, reduce_lr])\\n```\\n\\nWe obtain a val_accurcay of 85%, which is sufficient for our further analysis. Note that a BERT or a RoBERTa would have certainly had a better val_loss, as they are more heavy and complex.\\n\\n## Recovery of attention coefficients\\nWe are now able to analyze the attention coefficients related to movie reviews. In order to retrieve it, We need to predict the sentiment associated to a review.\\nThen, we select the layer(s) of attention to analyze. We focus here on the last layer of attention.\\n\\n```\\ninputs = tokenizer.batch_encode_plus(reviews,truncation=True, \\n                                     add_special_tokens = True, \\n                                     max_length = max_len, \\n                                     pad_to_max_length = True)\\n\\ntokenized = np.array(inputs[\\"input_ids\\"]).astype(\\"int32\\")\\nattention_mask = np.array(inputs[\\"attention_mask\\"]).astype(\\"int32\\")\\nencoded_att = model.layers[2](tokenized,attention_mask =attention_mask)\\n#last attention layer\\nlast_attention=encoded_att.attentions[-1]\\n```\\n\\nWe finally recovered the 12 attention matrices from the last layer of the DistilBert.\\n\\n## Interpreting through attention attribution\\nA first way to take advantage of the attention coefficients is to directly look at their value in order to evaluate if the right words stand out. We choose to calculate the average attention on all attention layers and heads. A more in-depth work of selection of the most relevant layer would allow to refine the interpretability method. Here, we limit ourselves to the most basic case.\\n\\n```\\na,b = [], []\\nfor head in range(0,12) :\\n    for i, elt in enumerate(inputs[\'input_ids\'][0]):\\n        if np.array(elt) != 1:\\n            att = last_attention.numpy()[0,head][0][i]\\n            a.append(tokenizer.decode([elt]) + \'_\' + str(i))\\n            b.append(att)\\n            \\nattention_all_head=pd.DataFrame({\\"Token\\":a,\\"Attention coefficient\\":b})\\n```\\n\\nIn order to have the average attention, we group by the attention score on all the layers and heads.\\nWe finally have the average attention coefficients associated with the words of the film review. As an example, the attention coefficients associated with the following positive review is calculated:\\n\\n\u201c_Probably my all time favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause but its not preachy or boring . it just never gets old despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years . paul lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a delight . the kids are as grandma says more like dressedup midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch . and the mothers slow awakening to whats happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling . if i had a dozen thumbs they\u2019d all be up for this movie_\\".\\n\\nThe review being long, we represent the text in color. The more red the color, the higher the associated attention coefficient. The result is shown below:\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n ![screenshot-app](img/Interpretability_sentiment_analysis/part_I/Image_4.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 3 - Attention-Based token importance\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n <p>&nbsp;</p>\\nWe see that the word groups \\"favorite movie\\", \\"it just never gets old\\", \\"performance brings tears\\", or \\"it is believable and startling\\" stand out. This explains well why the algorithm evaluated the review as positive and what was the semantic field at the root of this prediction.\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n## Next step\\nWe will show in a future article how attention coefficients are useful for generating counterfactual examples to explain the model prediction.\\n\\n\\n## References\\n\\n[1] VASWANI, Ashish, SHAZEER, Noam, PARMAR, Niki, et al.

The main objective of this article is to introduce Reinforcement Learning as a way to solve combinatorial optimization problems (Reinforcement Learning can actually be used to solve a much wider range of optimization problems). \\n\\nFirst, the classical Reinforcement Learning framework will be briefly presented. Then, we\'ll see how to frame the multi-knapsack problem for Reinforcement Learning, followed by explanations on why we chose to explore RL for this combinatorial optimization problem. Eventually, the Q-learning (no neural networks) and Policy Gradient (with neural networks) approaches will be introduced and their performance will be evaluated on the knapsack problem.\\n\\n\\n## Reinforcement Learning for the Knapsack problem \\n\\n### What is Reinforcement Learning?\\n\\nThe image below represents the Reinforcement Learning framework. It describes in a simple, yet accurate manner, one of the main ideas behind Reinforcement Learning. \\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/reinforcement-learning-framework.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 1 : The Reinforcement Learning framework\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\nBasically, an agent receives information about the state of an environment he evolves in, information we will call S<sub>t</sub> as it describes the state at timestep t.\\n\\nBased on this information it receives, the RL agent will choose an action among all the actions it has the right to take at each timestep. We will call such action A<sub>t</sub>, the action at time t, with A<sub>t</sub> belonging to AA<sub>t</sub>(s<sub>t</sub>) the set of available actions given the state S<sub>t</sub>. When an action is taken, it has an impact on the environment and the agent will receive information about the new state of the environment S<sub>t+1</sub> but also a reward to incentivize it to take actions which will maximize the total rewards it expects to obtain at the end of an episode.\\n\\nTo apply reinforcement learning to solve business problems, these problems have to be framed as a Markov Decision Process, as seen above. More details can be found on how to rigorously define the Reinforcement Learning in the [excellent course given by David Silver](https://deepmind.com/learning-resources/-introduction-reinforcement-learning-david-silver) (principal research scientist at DeepMind, now owned by Google). You may find his lectures using the previous link, with lectures 1 and 2 being the most pertinent.\\n\\nNow, to get a better grasp on how to frame a problem for Reinforcement Learning, let\u2019s consider two practical examples.\\n\\nAs a first example, we can consider for instance an AI trader. It could have as available actions the possibility to buy or sell many different products. Its actions have an impact on the environment. First, the money it has and the products it owns will be modified, but also if it buys a massive amount of a certain product, it may have an important impact on the future prices. The final goal for it may be to earn as much money as possible. The description of this first example with the prism of Reinforcement Learning is given in figure 2.\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/Example_AI_Trader_no_logo.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Figure 2 - Example of an AI trader described through the prism of Reinforcement Learning\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\nFor the case of a self driving car as the AI agent, the actions it can take could be turning, stopping, accelerating. The information it will receive at each timestep are the speed of the car, its geolocation and probably many others. The environment can be the real world around the car, or just a simulator. The final reward will take into account how fast the car has reached a certain goal position, without damaging things or killing people for instance. Should it damage objects, it could for instance receive negative rewards. This information is summarized in the figure 3 below.\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/Example_self_driving_car_no_logo.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Figure 3 - Example of a self driving car described through the prism of Reinforcement Learning\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\nLet\u2019s now tackle the case of the multi-knapsack problem!\\n\\n### How to adapt the multi-Knapsack problem for solving with Reinforcement Learning\\n\\nThe precise definition of the multi-knapsack problem was given in the first part of this serie of articles on the knapsack problem. The figure below describes visually the problem at stake.\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/Knapsack_problem_5.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Figure 4 - Description of the multi-knapsack problem\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nIn our case, one could think about the agent as a person trying to carefully choose among the many clothes he/she possesses before going on a long trip. The environment would be the empty bags and all the clothes to choose from. At each timestep, the person would have the choice to take one element among the available clothes to put it inside one of the bags, the bags needing to be closed (and thus not to full) before leaving for the trip.\\n\\nThe objective is to maximize the value of the clothes chosen for the trip.\\n\\n\\nAnd that\u2019s it! Our problem is framed for Reinforcement Learning.\\n\\n\\n### Why we chose to explore RL for combinatorial optimization problems\\nThe last two decades have known the breakthrough of Deep Learning which is now massively entering all fields of industry whether this is for Computer Vision, disease predictions, product recommendation, Natural Language Processing applications, etc. Massive investments follow in the field of Machine Learning implying a virtuous circle with more results and regular new breakthroughs. Due to these developments, Deep Reinforcement Learning has emerged from the field of Reinforcement Learning which has been studied for a long time and whose goal is to take actions in an environment in order to maximize a defined cumulative reward. This allowed new recent breakthroughs, such as the AI AlphaGo beating professional Go players in 2016 and more recently AlphaStar beating world champions of the video game Starcraft (more on that in [DeepMind blog article](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii) or in the [Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1724-z.epdf?author_access_token=lZH3nqPYtWJXfDA10W0CNNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PSZcPzJFGNAZhOlk4deBCKzKm70KfinloafEF1bCCXL6IIHHgKaDkaTkBcTEv7aT-wqDoG1VeO9-wO3GEoAMF9bAOt7mJ0RWQnRVMbyfgH9A%3D%3D)). \\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/AlphaStar_Image.png)\\n\\nFigure 5 - Visualization highlighting the trained AlphaStar performing against a top Starcraft human players\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nWe\u2019ll say a few words about this video game environment, because this achievement is one of the reasons which motivates the use of Reinforcement Learning for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Indeed, with the knapsack problem, we have a discrete action space with a limited number of actions, although the range of available actions can become extremely high by changing the number of available items and knapsacks. \\n\\nHaving an AI agent beating the world\u2019s best players on this game is an important breakthrough as this video game environment is extremely complex, with only imperfect information being provided to the agent, the action space being enormous with a choice between up to 10<sup>26</sup> different actions, and actions being taken almost in real time, every 0.2 seconds. Eventually, planning is made on long term and the agent doesn\u2019t know until the end of the game whether it has won the game or not. While applying Deep Reinforcement Learning to video games allows to test the performance of the algorithms very accurately, allowing to judge how it performs in very different environments, applications also begin to appear in other fields, opening the perspective of using these techniques in different industry fields in the next few years. Deep Reinforcement Learning is definitely a field with high potential, and proofs have been shown that it can solve very well high-dimensional problems. Especially, many articles were published where these algorithms were applied to finance problems.\\n\\nNow that we have seen the potential of Reinforcement Learning for solving a problem such as the knapsack problem, it is important to keep in mind some important characteristics of Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches: \\n\\n- Reinforcement Learning algorithms provides us with approximations of the optimal solutions on the contrary to the solutions that could provide Mixed Integer Programming solvers as the ones introduced in the first part of this series of articles on the knapsack problem;\\n- For the same reason, Reinforcement Learning algorithms will always provide us solutions to the problem, on the contrary to exact methods which could be unable to provide any solution for very complex problems. For that reason, Reinforcement Learning approaches are for instance being developed in order to solve partial differential equations of very high dimensionality, where usual solvers are unable to provide a solution;\\n- Reinforcement Learning algorithms perform online optimization, meaning that once they have been trained, they are able to solve very complex problems immediately. They have thus tremendous potential for applications which require to solve problems very frequently in a limited time window, such as in trading or product recommendation for instance.\\n\\nAs seen in the beginning of this section, Reinforcement Learning algorithms have a very high potential for a wide range of business problems. Let\'s now introduce one of the two Reinforcement Learning approaches used in this notebook. The first one, the Q-learning approach, isn\'t based on neural networks and doesn\'t scale well when the dimensionality of the problem increases. We have studied it as it is at the core of other important algorithms such as Deep Q Learning, much more powerful. We will thus concentrate on another promising approach, based on neural networks: the Policy Gradient approach.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Using Q-Learning and Policy Gradient algorithms on the Knapsack problem\\n\\n### A simple introduction to Policy Gradient \\nThe basic principle with a policy gradient approach is that, for each state _s_ received as input, our algorithm will provide us a probability distribution for the actions to take, allowing us to know which object our algorithm recommands us to put first in the knapsack.\\n\\nIn the formula below, \ud835\udf0b gives us this probability. More precisely, \ud835\udf0b gives us the probability to take action _a_ knowing that we currently at state _s_ and given the \ud835\udf03 values of the model parameters, neurons in our case as we use neural networks. \\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/policy_gradient_equation_2.svg)\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nThe use of neural networks isn\'t mandatory here, but very frequent to obtain good results on complex problems. An example of a representation of a simple neural network is given recalled below.  \\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/classical_neural_network_image_2.png)\\n\\nFigure 6 - Representation of a simple neural network\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nOur model architecture can be visualized with this representation. If we dig a bit deeper into the details of our model\'s architecture, we have:\\n\\n- As input of the neural network, a description of the current state of the system, that is the value and price information for all items, information about the already selected items and about the current and maximum weight limit inside the different bags;\\n\\n- Thanks to this information, our model associates to each possible action a probability and we can then select the action that the algorithm recommends us to take first, that is which object should be stored in which knapsack at the current timestep. This is the output of our model;\\n\\n- The parameters of this model, the neurons, are updated at the end of each episode, an episode beginning when all the objects are available and ending when the bags are sufficiently full (or all objects have been selected...). The update of the parameters (\ud835\udf03) of the model taking place at the end of each episode only and not each time an action is proposed by the model, the approach is called a __Monte Carlo approach__;\\n\\n- The updates of the parameters are made in order to maximize the value of the items stored inside the knapsacks and this approach is based on techniques such as __stochastic gradient descent__.\\n\\nNow that the Policy Gradient has been described, let\'s see how our algorithms performed on the knapsack problem!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Evaluating the performance of the RL algorithms\\n\\nAs summarized in figure 7 below, in order to evaluate the performance of the different algorithms, we chose to apply our two RL algorithms (Q-Learning and Policy Gradient) to 3 different environments of increasing difficulty. We trained each algorithm over 400 episodes.\\n\\nAt the beginning of a new experience, the algorithm had all its coefficients reinitialized. We perform several experiences in order to evaluate how robust is the algorithm. \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/evaluation_rl_algos_2.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Figure 7 - Description of the evaluation process for the different algorithms\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\nEventually, we evaluated the performance of the algorithms with 3 metrics:\\n- The mean reward shows how good on average the algorithm is;\\n- The standard deviation highlights the potential lack of robustness of the algorithm;\\n- The performance ratio RL vs MILP tells us how close is the RL algorithm to the optimal solution provided by a MILP solver (details on how to obtain such a solution are given in the notebook). \\n\\n\\n\\n### Results with Q-Learning (no neural networks)\\n\\nThe graphs on the left show that overall our Q-Learning algorithm does indeed improve through training as its reward improved over time. However, we can see that the performance ratio RL vs MILP is very low, meaning that it is far from achieving as good results as what we could get using state-of-the-art MILP solvers.\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/performance_q_learning_knapsack_4.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Figure 8 - Performance of the Q-Learning algorithm\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nFurthermore, environments of increasing complexity / dimensionality will be much more difficult to handle for Q-Learning, as its Q-value matrix has as number of columns the number of items multiplied by the number of knapsacks and as rows all the possible states which could exist. Increasing only slightly the number of knapsacks or bags will thus quickly make the Q-Learning algorithm unusable.\\n\\n### Results with Policy Gradient (based on neural networks)\\n\\nThe results of the learning process with Policy Gradient are much better than with Q-learning. At the beginning, due to random initialization of the neural network parameters, the actions are taken at random and the reward is very low, but it quickly improves until reaching a local maximum, not global as it is still lower than the solution obtained with the MILP solver. \\n\\nThe performance ratio is quite good on the three different environments, reaching approximately 80% for each. The algorithm scales well when the complexity increases.\\n\\nWe see however that the standard deviation is quite high, which highlights the fact that each time a model is initialized, it can converge to quite different values. It is thus not extremely robust and several initializations are required before finding good results approaching the optimal solution.\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/performance_policy_gradient_knapsack_2.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Figure 9 - Performance of the REINFORCE (policy-gradient approach) algorithm\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nOn the graph below are highlighted some of the limitations we have witnessed with Policy Gradient algorithms such as the REINFORCE algorithm. We have a lack of robustness, having our algorithm sometimes working very well, sometimes leading to a poorer reward.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/robustness_pb_policy_gradient_2.png)\\n\\nFigure 10 - REINFORCE algorithm (gradient-policy approach) appears as lacking robustness\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\nFor that reason, the hyperparameter tuning is made more complicated. Indeed comparing one combination of hyperparameters with another one isn\'t enough to be certain about which combination of hyperparameters is the best, because of the high variability of results for fixed hyperparameters. \\n\\n## Opening\\n\\nFor obtaining the results given in this article, we reproduced classical Reinforcement Learning algorithms: the Q-learning algorithm which does not rely on the use of neural networks, and a Policy Gradient algorithm which relies on neural networks. We saw that the latter obtained much better results than the former as we could expect. \\n\\nWe also built our own multi-knapsack environment file, allowing us to easily modify greatly the complexity of the environment by increasing both the number of available items to put in the knapsacks and the number of knapsacks. \\n\\nWhile creating the environment file, we followed the nomenclature proposed by Open AI Gym for building Reinforcement Learning environments, using the same method names used to define an Open AI Gym environment. The objective was to be able to experiment much more quickly in the future by making use of one of the different Deep Reinforcement Learning libraries (Stable Baselines, TF Agents, Tensorforce\u2026). Indeed, these libraries allow access to many different advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms already implemented, which can directly be used on new problems if the environment file describing the problem has been built using Open AI Gym nomenclature.\\n\\nAnother article will be written soon to tell more about how to perform hyperparameter tuning for RL using the hyperparameter optimization framework [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) and how to compare and evaluate the efficiency of many different RL algorithms using [Stable Baselines](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/)!\\n\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"/2022/08/27/traditional_or","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/08/27/traditional_or","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-27-traditional_or.md","title":"Deep RL and Optimization applied to Operations Research problem - 1/2 Traditional Optimization techniques","description":"This article is part of a series of articles which will introduce several optimization techniques, from traditional (yet advanced) Mathematical Optimization solvers and associated packages to Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms, while tackling a very famous Operations Research problem: the multi-knapsack problem.

Then, the multi-knapsack problem itself is introduced. Then we apply the rules defined before on how to solve optimization problems and obtain the optimal solution to the multi-knapsack problem, formulated as a Mixed Integer problem and using Python-MIP package. Let\'s now introduce simple steps one can follow to approach optimization problems with optimization solvers.\\n\\n\\n## Main steps while creating an optimization model to solve a business problem\\n\\nOnce a business problem that could benefit from optimization has been identified, we can define a systematic approach based on 3 steps for solving all kind of optimization problems with optimization solvers. These 3 steps are highlighted in the figure below.\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/3_steps_math_modelling_4.png)\\n\\nFigure 1 : The 3 main steps for solving a business problem through optimization\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n\\nIn more details, these 3 steps are: \\n\\n1. __Create the conceptual mathematical model__ that defines the different variables, constraints, etc. in the business problem. This step consists in writing down on paper the equations that define our problem. \\n\\n2. __Translate the conceptual mathematical model into a computer program__. For most programming languages used for optimization, the computer program will largely resembles the mathematical equations one would write on paper.\\n\\n3. __Solve the mathematical model using a math programming solver__. The solver available for Mathematical Programming (solvers such as GLPK, Gurobi, CPLEX...) relies on very sophisticated algorithms. Important algorithms and ideas used in these solvers are, among many others: simplex method, branch & bound, use of heuristics...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLet\'s see those 3 steps for the case of the multi-knapsack problem.\\n\\n\\n## The multi-knapsack problem\\n\\n\\nThe objective here is, given a set of _n_ items and a set of _m_ knapsacks, to __maximize__ the total value of the items put in the knapsacks without exceeding their capacity.\\n\\nBelow,  w<sub>i</sub> represents the weight of item i,  p<sub>i</sub> the value of item i while  c<sub>j</sub> represents the capacity of knapsack j.\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/Knapsack_problem_5.png)\\n\\nFigure 2: Description of the multi-knapsack problem\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n\\nThe multi-knapsack is an extension of the classical knapsack problem where instead of considering only one knapsack, we consider as many as we want. This allows to easily extend the complexity of this problem.\\n\\nWhile the problem is relatively easy to define mathematically, it belongs to the class of NP-hard problems. Without going into the details of what defines NP-hard problems, we can easily see that the complexity of the knapsack problems explodes when the number of knapsacks and items increases. Indeed, we have m<sup>n</sup> available combinations we would need to test should we want to apply a brute-force approach for solving this problem. Just with 10 knapsacks and 80 items, there are 10<sup>80</sup> combinations, which is the estimation of the number of atoms in the universe! And 10 knapsacks and 80 items is still quite limited... Let\'s now try to create the conceptual mathematical model by defining the problem with equations.\\n\\n\\n### Creating the conceptual mathematical model\\n\\nA quick translation of the multi-knapsack problem with equation can be written as the following: \\n\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/equations_1.svg)\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/equations_3.svg)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\nNow that we managed to translate the problem into a set of equations, let\'s translate this mathematical model so that it is understood by a computer program. Below, we will make use of the Python package [Python-MIP](https://www.python-mip.com/) which is open-source and provides tools for modeling and solving Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Problems (MIP), relying on fast open source solvers.\\n\\n### Translating the mathematical model into a computer program with Python-MIP\\n\\nBefore solving the problem, we have to generate an instance for it (have data defining the problem). To do so, you can use the following code that will generate an instance of this problem with 40 items to store in 5 bags.\\n\\n```\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport pickle\\n\\ndef data_generator_knapsack(number_bags, number_items, minimum_weight_item, maximum_weight_item, minimum_value_item, maximum_value_item, max_weight_bag):\\n    data = {}\\n    weights = np.random.randint(minimum_weight_item, maximum_weight_item, size = number_items)\\n    values = np.random.randint(minimum_value_item, maximum_value_item, size = number_items)\\n    data[\'weights\'] = weights\\n    data[\'values\'] = values\\n    data[\'items\'] = list(range(len(weights)))\\n    data[\'num_items\'] = len(weights)\\n    data[\'bins\'] = list(range(number_bags))\\n    data[\'bin_capacities\'] = np.random.randint(0, max_weight_bag, size = number_bags) + np.int(np.mean(data[\'weights\']))\\n    return(data)\\n\\nnumber_bags = 5\\nnumber_items = 40\\nminimum_weight_item = 0\\nmaximum_weight_item = 75\\nminimum_value_item = 0\\nmaximum_value_item = 75\\nmax_weight_bag = 150\\n\\ndata = data_generator_knapsack(number_bags, number_items, minimum_weight_item, maximum_weight_item, minimum_value_item, maximum_value_item, max_weight_bag)\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nLet\'s now import the package used to have access to the MIP solver, here using the python package Python-MIP:\\n\\n```\\nfrom mip import Model, xsum, maximize, BINARY\\n```\\n\\nNow, we can translate the mathematical model so that it is understood by Python-MIP. \\n\\n```\\ndef mip_solve_knapsack(data):\\n\\n  model = Model(\\"knapsack\\")\\n\\n  x = [[model.add_var(var_type=BINARY) for i in data[\'items\']] for j in data[\'bins\']]\\n\\n  model.objective = maximize(xsum((xsum(data[\'values\'][i] * x[j][i] for i in data[\'items\']) for j in data[\'bins\'])))\\n\\n  for j in data[\'bins\']:\\n      model += xsum(data[\'weights\'][i] * x[j][i] for i in data[\'items\']) <= data[\'bin_capacities\'][j]\\n\\n  # Each item can be in at most one bin\\n  for i in data[\'items\']:\\n      model += xsum(x[j][i] for j in data[\'bins\']) <= 1\\n\\n  model.optimize()\\n  \\n  return(model)\\n```\\n\\nRemark how close it is from the original equations! These solvers are very powerful and yet easy to use directly in Python. The code is indeed very close to the original equations. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Solving the mathematical model with Python-MIP\\n\\nUsing the **mip_solve_knapsack** function defined in the previous section, we can access to important information regarding the problem, such as the final objective value and the values of x<sub>ij</sub> telling us what were the best combinations of items inside knapsacks.\\n\\n\\n### Some Mathematical Optimization packages\\n\\nIn the notebook associated to this article, the package Python-MIP was used. __Python-MIP__ is free, but many other packages exist for solving optimization problems on Python (and other languages of course like Julia). For instance __OR-Tools__ from Google is a well-recognized free solver, with [detailed documentation](https://developers.google.com/optimization/introduction/overview). \\n\\nOn the other side, __Gurobi__ is a very popular commercial solution for mathematical optimization and its documentation is extremely rich, with quick introductions about [Mathematical Programming](https://www.gurobi.com/resource/modeling-basics/), [Linear Programming](https://www.gurobi.com/resource/mip-basics/) and [Mixed-Integer Programming](https://www.gurobi.com/resource/mip-basics/). Importantly, it has a [large number of modeling examples from all industry fields](https://www.gurobi.com/resource/modeling-examples-using-the-gurobi-python-api-in-jupyter-notebook/) directly available on Google Colab allowing to better grasp notions of Mathematical Modelling and to improve modeling skills to tackle all kind of optimization problems with Python. This resource can be of use even if one doesn\'t plan to use this commercial software but rather a free package such as OR-Tools.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn this article was introduced the multi-knapsack problem, an NP-complete problem, very difficult to solve when taking many items and bags. \\n\\nThe approach to solve the multi-knapsack problem relied on Python-MIP, a free optimization package using powerful MILP solvers to solve very efficiently all kinds of optimization problems.\\n\\nIn the next part of this series on the multi-knapsack problem, well studied in the field of Operations Research and at the heart of many real optimization problems, we\'ll highlight how Deep Reinforcement Learning can be used in order to solve combinatorial optimization problems such as this one.

The reason behind this is that time series, data measured over time, are omnipresent in our day-to-day life and are used in a wide range of industries. For instance, in the retail industry, forecasting is a crucial task to optimize processes and increase efficiency. Many examples can be found in the literature mainly focusing on demand forecasting [1] and sales forecasting [2].\\n\\nIn the past, retail companies have relied on traditional time series forecasting approaches based on statistics. More recently, companies and researchers have grown interest in machine learning and deep learning techniques and algorithms to predict the demand more accurately among other requirements. To evolve as a leader in data science, at Ekimetrics, we keep an eye on the state-of-the-art of time series forecasting and investigate new techniques to eventually, adopt them and improve our solutions in the long run.\\n\\nThis article will focus on our journey with __neural ordinary differential equations__ (neural ODEs) applied to time series forecasting and specifically focused on a client\u2019s use case.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Selling magazines\\n\\nBefore entering into the subject, if you have not read our article on how we use Bayesian inference to increase our predictions of magazines sales have a look at it [here](https://ekimetrics.github.io/blog/2022/06/14/bayesian_inference/). It is an interesting application of a Bayesian framework to enhance sales prediction for a publisher. Our exploration of neural ODEs focuses on the same use case.\\n\\nIn the world of newspapers and magazines, it is crucial to be able to estimate the final volume of sales for accounting and management purposes. Indeed, publishers adjust their production and distribution of issues based on these forecasts. Conventionally, the projections rely strongly on the domain expertise of the people in charge. But nowadays, with all recent advances in the field of data science and improvements with regards to data availability, publishers can leverage modern forecasting techniques to enhance their predictions.  \\n\\nThe figure below, Fig. 1, represents the cumulative sales of a magazine composed by a set of 14 different issues. Note that the data have been anonymized for confidentiality purposes. Our task is to use the observed data, including the sales curves of all historical issues and the beginning part of the current issue\u2019s curve, to predict the final sales of the current issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/neural_ode/image_1_bis.png)\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Fig. 1: Example of magazine sales curves\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n## Introduction to neural ODEs\\n\\nIn this section we provide an overview of what neural ODEs are, and what makes them so special. For the curious readers, complementary resources and blog posts that present this topic in detail, are provided at the end of this article.\\n\\nTo understand neural ODEs, we need to introduce some basic concepts on neural networks (NNs). In essence, NNs are a succession of input, hidden and output layers originally inspired by the human brain. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is one the most popular feedforward neural network due to its simplicity. By means of activation functions and linear combinations of the input data, these networks introduce non linearities and become universal approximators [3]. The equation h(t+1) = f(ht, \u03b8t), captures the evolution of the hidden layers of a MLP network with ht referring to the previous layer and \u03b8t to a parameter of the network. Without entering too much into the details, these networks are usually trained by minimizing a loss function and backpropagation, propagating the computed error, and updating the weights accordingly.\\n\\nWhat we must keep in mind here is that these networks have a limited number of layers and thus, of evaluation points. Could we achieve an infinite number of evaluation points for time continuous applications? The instinctive answer is no since we cannot have an infinite number of layers. However, we are going to review some interesting properties of residual networks (ResNet) that will help us answer this question.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/neural_ode/image_2.png)\\n\\nFig. 2: ResNet schema [4]\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nA ResNet is a neural network that has an architecture based on the pattern pictured in Fig. 2 which entails that the network follows the equation h<sub>t+1</sub> = h<sub>t</sub> + f(h<sub>t</sub>, \u03b8<sub>t</sub>). This equation might be familiar to some readers with a background in mathematics since it resembles Euler\u2019s method. In short, this method is useful to solve initial value problems, a problem modelled by an ordinary differential equation with an initial condition. Interestingly, a residual network adds hidden states between the input and the output and discretizes the continuous relationship between them, which is similar to Euler\'s method. In [5] the authors take a different approach by considering the continuous limit of each discrete layer of the network. Thus, instead of having a discrete number of layers, the progression of the hidden states is continuous, obtaining the following equation where h(t) is the value of the hidden state evaluated for some t.\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> d\u210e(\ud835\udc61)/\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc53(\u210e(\ud835\udc61), \ud835\udf03<sub>t</sub>, \ud835\udc61)\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\nThen, in a neural ODE the hidden state dynamic can be parametrized by the equation above where \ud835\udc53(\u210e(\ud835\udc61), \ud835\udf03<sub>t</sub>, \ud835\udc61) is a neural network parametrized by \ud835\udf03<sub>t</sub> at layer t. Therefore, it is possible to solve this ODE by solving its integral.\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> h(t) = \u222b f(h(t), \ud835\udf03<sub>t</sub>, t)\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nBy means of a numerical ODE method, it is possible to evaluate the network at any desired depth. And thus, it is possible to approximate functions over these hidden state dynamics by using ODE solvers such as:\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \u0177 = h(t<sub>1</sub>) = ODESolve(h(t<sub>0</sub>), t<sub>0</sub>, t<sub>1</sub>, \ud835\udf03<sub>t</sub>, f)\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, if we go back to our initial question regarding the possibility of having an infinite or quasi-infinite number of evaluation points, we can state that neural ODEs enable us to achieve that Fig. 3 illustrates this idea by comparing the vector field created by a traditional residual network and an ODE network. In essence, an ODE network defines a continuous vector field since this network can be evaluated at any depth. Whereas, on the other hand, the residual network is limited to a discrete number of layers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/neural_ode/image_3.png)\\n\\nFig. 3: Comparison between a ResNet and an ODE network vector fields transformations [5]\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nBefore moving on to the applications of neural ODEs, it is important to note the endeavor of performing backpropagation. Essentially, the more evaluation points you have in your network, the higher the number of intermediate forward passes to store. To overcome this, the authors of the original paper [5] which received the 2018 NeurIPS best paper award, introduced a mathematical trick known as the Adjoint method. We will not get into the details here, but you can dig deeper into this concept by checking the resources we have left at the end of this article.\\n\\n## Applications of neural ODEs\\n\\nThe main advantage of neural ODEs is the possibility of working with continuous-time series models. In addition, they are generally more memory efficient than other networks such as the MLP and can gain from adaptive computation since modern ODE solvers allow to monitor the level of error and adapt the evaluation strategy. For example, we can reduce accuracy for low power applications.\\n\\nAll these benefits make neural ODEs a great tool for applications dealing with continuous time systems, irregularly sampled data, and scalable and invertible normalizing flows. Besides, neural ODEs are very interesting for time series forecasting too. Basically, they can be used to fit time series and then extrapolate them. Since 2018, we have seen an increasing number of scientific papers presenting neural ODEs to deal with forecasting challenges in the energy [6] and the healthcare [7] sectors.\\n\\nComing back to our specific use case, although Fig. 1 introduced at the beginning of this article shows that applying a curve fitting model does not seem like a feasible option, we considered our sales curves as trajectories to employ neural ODE models to fit the curves and forecast the final volumes of sales. We can formulate our problem with the following equation.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> x\u03b8<sub>t+1</sub> = x\u03b8<sub>0</sub> + \u222b b(x\u03b8<sub>u</sub>, u) du\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere x is an issue belonging to a magazine and b in our case is a neural network, something resembling to b(x\u03b8<sub>u</sub>, u) = MLP(x\u03b8<sub>u</sub>), with its corresponding parameters.\\n\\n## Results\\n\\nInitially, we have used a standard neural ODE network to deal with our time series forecasting use case. The figure below, Fig. 4, is an animation representing the fitting of a curve of sales of a specific issue. Bear in mind that the data have been anonymized for privacy purposes.\\n\\nIn this figure, we can observe that the model is able to fit the curve successfully after some iterations. The idea then is to fit the sales curves from all historical issues and the beginning part of the current issue\u2019s curve to predict the final sales by extrapolation. Although we have obtained promising results, they are not good enough. The main reason being that neural ODEs are well suited for deterministic systems and in our case, we deal with a non-deterministic one.\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/neural_ode/curve_fitting.gif)\\n\\nFig. 4: Curve fitting of the sales curve of an issue\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n\\nInspired by the ideas presented in [8], instead of a standard neural ODE network like the one introduced before, we have been recently working with stochastic differential neural networks (SDEs). SDEs are a type of continous neural network enabling to introduce a stochastic component and consequently, work with non-deterministic systems and consider external factors. We have obtained promising preliminary results with this procedure, but they require further analysis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn this article, we have introduced you into the world of neural ordinary differential equations applied to time series forecasting. We have gone through a short theoretical explanation and presented you our exploration with neural ODEs to strengthen predictions for a magazine publisher.\\n\\nAt Ekimetrics, we accompany a large portfolio of clients across a wide range of industries to help them steer their data opportunity, build capabilities, and deploy actionable DS solutions to power up a sustainable growth. As a leader in the field of data science, we perform recurring technological watches and stay tuned on the state-of-the-art of the fields of machine learning and deep learning. As stated during this article, we are particularly interested in time series and investigate recent advances on the subject to eventually, embrace them and expand our solutions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## References\\n\\n[1] J.

However, pandas has inner limitations when working with large datasets. Alternatives for distributed computing exist but each of them requires us to skill up. The main barrier is the syntax required by the language which is often complex. Different packages tried to simplify the process (koalas for instance) but we want to focus ourselves on Fugue. Fugue is described as a \u201cunified interface for distributed computing that lets users execute Python, pandas, and SQL code on Spark and Dask without rewrites\u201d. Fugue does not require a lot of time to get used to it and is a good common tool for SQL users and python ones. We invite you to watch the video here under which contextualizes Fugue and provides some useful background. \\n\\n[Why Pandas-like Interfaces are Sub-optimal for Distributed Computing | by Kevin Kho | Jun, 2022 | Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-pandas-like-interfaces-are-sub-optimal-for-distributed-computing-322dacbce43)\\n\\n[Talk - Kevin Kho/Han Wang: Comparing the Different Ways to Scale Python and Pandas Code - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ae0m_XTys)\\n\\n## Machine Learning\\n\\n### In-hand NLP search tool backed by Transformers and Q&A: Haystack\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/newsletter_june_2022/Image_2.png)\\n</div>\\n\\nDeepset, a German NLP start-up, released a bit more than a year ago a powerful and simple tool: Haystack. Haystack is a comprehensive framework enabling its users to use state-of-the-art Question Answering model to browse large textual datasets. Haystack is a local and little search engine. It is meant to be used by a broad range of users (from beginners to expert). You can tailor some part of the interface and even modify back-end specificities such as the backbone model used (Bert, Roberta, Luke\u2026). \\n\\n[GitHub - deepset-ai/haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack)\\n\\n### Liquid Neural Network: Next generation model for sequential data \\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/newsletter_june_2022/Image_3.png)\\n</div>\\n\\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) demonstrated a strong performance when used for sequential data. RNN are made of complex recurrent units enabling the network to keep track of past information while new inputs are fed in. In 2018, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations appeared and were seen as a major change in how we are modelling data. Instead of modeling the true generative function of Y, we are looking to model its derivative. This article was seen as a major change in how we can shift from a discrete model state to a continuous one. \\nLiquid Time Constant Networks (LTC) were introduced in 2020 with a strong emphasis on the concept of hidden state in the model. In previous models, hidden state at time t is optimized according to the output at time t (maximizing the accuracy). In LTCs, hidden state is used both to predict the output, but also the next hidden state t+1. It means that at each time-step, you update your memory, according to what you saw, see and expect to see in the future. This application is particularly powerful when you need to generate data at a given horizon. If you want a quick deep dive in LTC you can follow the first link. The second one is the original paper that might be hard to read the in first instance.\\n\\n\\n[Liquid Neural Networks in Computer Vision | by Jacob Solawetz | Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/liquid-neural-networks-in-computer-vision-4a0f718b464e)\\n\\n[Article - Liquid Time-constant Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04439.pdf)\\n\\n## Data Engineering & Architecture\\n\\n### MongoDB vs ElasticSearch vs Redshift \\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/newsletter_june_2022/Image_4.png)\\n</div>\\n\\nDifferent tools exist when required to structure and organize a data architecture.

The task consists in detecting in a picture multiple instances and drawing a bounding box around it. Back in 2015, the state-of-the-art architecture is a Region-based Convolutional Neural Network or RCNN (followed by different improvement called Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN\u2026). To make it brief and simple, RCNN takes Regions Of Interest (ROIs), which are little rectangle cropped from the image, fed to a Neural Network. Eventually ROIs are pooled together to produce the true bounding boxes we want. The biggest limit of R-CNN is the ROIs generation part which can take a lot of time before getting a prediction (therefore improvements of R-CNN always have a speed related word).\\n\\nJon Redmon, who at the time was in the early years of his PhD, proposed a new architecture called YOLO (You Only Look Once). The framework approaches the task of object detection as a regression problem rather than a classification one (R-CNN uses a classifier to predict bounding boxes). He also modifies the framework to get a single network that can be trained and optimized. This change of loss enables the network to be fully trainable on the whole image. The model shows exceptional performance both for real-time detection, but also in terms of accuracy. \\n\\nFollowing this breakthrough, Jon Redmon worked on several new versions of YOLO, all becoming state-of-the-art in the field. However, in early 2020, he decided to stop his research in the field of Computer Vision as he saw a rise of ethical concerns around his work (especially in the military field). \\n\\nI strongly invite you to read (at least) his resume which is by far the best one in the AI field! Check out his website to deepen your knowledge about his research. If you want, you can also check his first Yolo paper which is amazing!\\n\\n[Redmon Resume (pjreddie.com)](https://pjreddie.com/static/Redmon%20Resume.pdf)\\n\\n[Survival Strategies for the Robot Rebellion (pjreddie.com)](https://pjreddie.com/)\\n\\n[You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf)\\n\\n## Credits\\n- Cover Photo by <a href=\\"https://unsplash.com/@cristofer?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\\">Cristofer Maximilian</a> on <a href=\\"https://unsplash.com/@cristofer?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\\">Unsplash</a>\\n  \\n</div>"},{"id":"/2022/06/14/bayesian_inference","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/06/14/bayesian_inference","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-14-bayesian_inference.md","title":"Bayesian inference for better predictions of magazine sales","description":"This article describes how Ekimetrics helped major press publishers using Bayesian inference for sales prediction.","date":"2022-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 14, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Bayesian Inference","permalink":"/blog/tags/bayesian-inference"},{"label":"Digital Transformation","permalink":"/blog/tags/digital-transformation"},{"label":"Sales Prediction","permalink":"/blog/tags/sales-prediction"},{"label":"AthenIA","permalink":"/blog/tags/athen-ia"}],"readingTime":7.655,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Duong Nguyen","title":"Senior Machine Learning Consultant","url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Bayesian inference for better predictions of magazine sales","author":"Duong Nguyen","author_title":"Senior Machine Learning Consultant","author_url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com","header_image_url":"./img/blog/press_printing.jpg","tags":["Bayesian Inference","Digital Transformation","Sales Prediction","AthenIA"],"draft":false,"description":"This article describes how Ekimetrics helped major press publishers using Bayesian inference for sales prediction.","keywords":["Data Science","EkiLab","Ekimetrics","Eki.Lab","Eki","Machine Learning","Artificial Intelligence","Data Science for business","Bayesian Inference","Sales Prediction","AthenIA","Digital Transformation"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Newsletter for June 2022","permalink":"/blog/2022/07/05/newsletter_June-2022"},"nextItem":{"title":"Newsletter for April 2022","permalink":"/blog/2022/05/02/newsletter_April-2022"}},"content":"\x3c!-- import useBaseUrl from \\"@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\\";\\n\\n<link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"{useBaseUrl(\'katex/katex.min.css\')}\\" />\\n --\x3e\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/bayesian_inference/press_printing.jpg)\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n<div align =\\"justify\\">\\n\\n\\n\\nWhether it\u2019s a tabloid that we quickly grabbed on the way to work, or a magazine with a free toy that we carefully selected for our kids on the way home, print newspapers have always been an integral ingredient in many people\u2019s lives. That feeling of getting to read something fresh off the press. That powdery smell of paper. That daily reading routine to get you awake every morning. All this, however, seems to bring a sense of nostalgia to most people now. \\n\\nThe newspaper sector is facing a tough time. The rapid and inevitable shift to digital content across domains has significantly reduced the audience size of the traditional press. At the same time, production costs have become more and more expensive. Covid-19 and lockdowns are changing customer behaviour. Altogether, these factors are rendering the industry\u2019s current distribution strategies obsolete. \\n\\nMore than ever, the industry needs to adapt itself to stay in the game. Many publishers are using data and data science techniques such as demand forecasting, sales prediction, supply optimization, and management dashboard to assist their business decisions.\\n\\nIn this article, we will shed a light on one of those tools: __sales prediction.__\\n\\n\\n\\n## Mobilis in Mobile (Jules Verne)\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/bayesian_inference/pen_paper.png)\\n\\nWhen a publisher sells a magazine issue, they need to estimate the total sales for accounting, financial and management purposes. For example, in accounting, the total sales are needed to calculate the estimated revenue and profit, which may later inform decision-makers to adjust the production and distribution of the next issues. Traditionally, the predictions are based on the domain expertise of the people in charge. However, with data becoming more and more available, we can leverage recent advances in machine learning to improve our predictions.\\n\\n\\nFig. 1 shows the cumulative sales of a magazine (the data have been anonymized for confidential purposes). The objective is to use the observed data, including the sales curves of all historical issues and the beginning part of the current issue\u2019s curve, to predict the final sales.  \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/bayesian_inference/sales_curves_3.png)\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Fig. 1: Example of magazine sales curves\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\nAs we can see from the figure, there is a high variability in the sales curves. Averaging the sales of historical issues does not provide a good prediction of the current issue. Naively applying a curve fitting model does not seem like a feasible option either. Furthermore, we do not have that much data to train a data-hungry model such as deep neural network. \\n\\n## Context and domain expertise are crucial!\\n\\nIn the real world, the sales of a magazine issue depends on several factors, such as the content and the cover of the issue (e.g. the better the content and the covers are, the more sales), the season (e.g. some magazine may sell better in summer), the holidays during the sale period (e.g. people may buy a magazine at the train station when they go on vacations). A good prediction model needs to consider those factors to be able to make precise forecasts.\\n\\nThere are two big questions: *which factors to take into account and how to encode them?*\\n\\nTo answer the first question, we need the insights of domain experts. They have been working in the industry for many years. More than anyone else, they understand their magazines, the market and customer behaviour. That knowledge is invaluable!\\n\\nFor the second question, there is a mathematical framework that allows us to incorporate the prior knowledge (provided by the domain experts and extracted from the data of historical issues) and the observations (the daily reported sales of the current issue) to make a better prediction: __Bayesian inference__. \\n\\n## Bayesian inference as a mathematical tool to combine the prior expectation and the new observed evidence\\n \\n![screenshot-app](img/bayesian_inference/bayesian_inference.png)\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Fig. 2: Bayesian inference\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nWith the insights provided by domain experts and extracted from the historical data, we can estimate an expectation of the sales of the current issue, prior to its sale period. However, even though the experts have a deep understanding of the product as well as the market, and the historical data may show some characteristics of the sales curves, there is always a grey zone of uncertainty and error. The market evolves; customers change their buying habits; some internal factors were poorly estimated; some external factors were not considered; some unexpected events happen during the sale period, etc. All those factors make the prediction which is purely based on historical experiences less reliable. \\n\\nAfter the sale of the current issue has taken place, we can cumulate the recorded sales to get the beginning part of its sales curve. The more time passes, the more observations are built up. Those observations provide the latest information of the reality and indicate how the real sales actually evolve. However, the observations themselves contain noise. For example, a point of sale may forget to record a sale or record it a few days late, preventing us from using purely the observations to make a precise prediction.\\n\\nSince we do not have enough subjective data, we can leverage Bayesian inference to fold in the prior knowledge that we have already had (thanks to the inputs of the experts and the historical sales) to draw stronger and sharper predictions. Mathematically, we model the sales by a random variable X that follows a distribution p(X|\u03b8) parameterised by a set of parameters \u03b8: X ~ p(X|\u03b8). The prediction problem is reduced to finding the \u201ccorrect\u201d \u03b8. Given the observations X<sub>obs</sub> (the sales records at the beginning of the sale period of the current issue in our case), frequentist approaches such as the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method find an optimal \u03b8 that best fits Xobs: \u03b8<sub>MLE</sub> = argmax<sub>\u03b8</sub>(p(X<sub>obs</sub>|\u03b8)), then plug it in to make the sales prediction: X<sup>pred</sup><sub>MLE</sub> = argmax<sub>X</sub>(p(X|\u03b8<sub>MLE</sub>)). However, X<sub>obs</sub> usually contain noise,  results in a bad estimation of \u03b8. With Bayesian inference, we can integrate our prior knowledge to get better predictions. Specifically, from the sales of historical issues and the inputs of the experts, we have an idea of how \u03b8 should be, modelled as the prior distribution p(\u03b8). Incorporating it with the information provided by the observations Xobs, we get the posterior distribution p(\u03b8|X<sub>obs</sub>), which is proportional to the prior p(\u03b8) and the likelihood p(X<sub>obs</sub>|\u03b8) (see Fig. 2): \\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> p(\u03b8|X<sub>obs</sub>) \u221d p(X<sub>obs</sub>|\u03b8)*p(\u03b8)\\n\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\nIn Bayesian inference, rather than predicting a single value of the sales, we predict its distribution, called the posterior predictive distribution:\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">p(X<sup>pred</sup><sub>Bayesian</sub>|X<sub>obs</sub>) = \u222bp(X<sup>pred</sup><sub>Bayesian</sub>|\u03b8)*p(\u03b8|X<sub>obs</sub>)d\u03b8\\n\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n\\nBy doing so, we take into account the uncertainty in the prior, as well as the fact that the observations are noisy. \\n\\n A pipeline\u2014implemented in Spark and PyMC3\u2014of the whole process, is depicted in Fig. 3. At the beginning, based on an analysis of the the characteristics of the issues and the market, the historical sales and the inputs of the experts, we estimate the prior p(\u03b8). During the sale period, this estimation will be regularly revised, updated and adjusted in light of the observations X<sub>obs</sub> to get the posterior  p(\u03b8|X<sub>obs</sub>), which is used to calculate the posterior predictive p(X<sup>\u03b8pred</sup><sub>Bayesian</sub>|X<sub>obs</sub>).   The posterior predictive is then formatted and sent to the decision-makers. \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/bayesian_inference/pred_pip.png)\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Fig. 3: Bayesian sales prediction pipeline\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n## Results\\n\\nFig. 4 shows an example of the prediction at day 30 of the sale period. We compare the performance of the Bayesian model with that of a frequentist baseline (in this example, is a logarithmic curve fitting model). Both the models are fed with the sales curves of historical issues and the sales records of the first 30 days of the current issue\u2019s sale. Additionally, the Bayesian model has the characteristics of the issues (cover, number of holidays during the sale period, etc.) as well as the opinions of the experts on the similarity between the current issue and some issues in the past. The objective is to predict  the sales of the rest 30 days. \\n\\nWe can observe that the prediction of the frequentist model is too optimistic because of the (false) positive signals during the first half of the sale period. By contrast, the 95% HDI (highest density interval) of the Bayesian prediction well covers the true sales. This is thanks to the prior insights that the Bayesian model has been given.  \\n\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/bayesian_inference/sales_pred.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Fig. 4: Example of the sales predictions of a magazine at day 30\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWe have walked through an example of how to make better predictions of magazine sales. Data and data science have revolutionized many domains. However, to make the most out of digital assets, a hand-in-hand collaboration between data scientists and business experts is much needed. \\n\\nSince 2018, Ekimetrics has been accompanying press publishers in their digital transformation journey.

However, Gradio is made to share pre-trained models meaning that it cannot be used as an Active Learning asset where data would be provided to the model iteratively to its training.

Continual Learning means to train a single model on various type of tasks iteratively. When being trained at step t, the model does not have access to previous data. One of the main challenge posed by such concept is how to maintain knowledge from past data into the model, avoiding catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, researchers propose an approach by leveraging prompt engineering. Using prompt Is very common in NLP as it tends to better fine-tune pretrained algorithms. The main idea of this paper is to tackle continual learning not as a model weights\u2019 shift but rather as a memory space representing the type of task to be trained on. \\n\\n[Learning to Prompt for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08654)\\n\\n## Data Engineering & Architecture\\n\\n### Putting ElasticSearch into production \\n\\n![](img/newsletter_april_2022/ElasticSearch.jpg)\\n\\nElasticSearch is a famous distributed search engine build on Apache Lucene.

It contains all the instructions to produce & reproduce it identically everywhere it will be run: on another laptop, maybe with a different OS, in the cloud.\\n\\nSome quick definitions:\\n* The Docker image is the result of the build of the Dockerfile.\\n* The Docker container is the result of running the image.\\n* You can pull and push images to a container registry.\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![Docker definitions schema](./img/docker-definitions-schema.gif)\\n</div>\\n\\n#### Choosing the base image\\nIt always starts with a **FROM** instruction that defines what is the base image which can be either:\\n* a linux-based OS: [ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/layers/ubuntu/library/ubuntu/latest/images/sha256-31cd7bbfd36421dfd338bceb36d803b3663c1bfa87dfe6af7ba764b5bf34de05?context=explore), [debian](https://hub.docker.com/layers/debian/library/debian/stable/images/sha256-7ec7bef742f919f7cc88f41b598ceeb6b74bcb446e9ce1d2d7c31eb26ccba624?context=explore), [centos](https://hub.docker.com/layers/centos/library/centos/latest/images/sha256-a1801b843b1bfaf77c501e7a6d3f709401a1e0c83863037fa3aab063a7fdb9dc?context=explore)...\\n* an OS with preinstalled tools: [python-3.8](https://hub.docker.com/layers/python/library/python/3.8/images/sha256-71d10e809efb1733e2743fb7be3417db18070e10a2276e727216f245f7418592?context=explore), [mongo-5.0.7](https://hub.docker.com/layers/mongo/library/mongo/5.0.7/images/sha256-5b5263a7d25d06d5149904eaaacdb359edcd4f26a3d971265f85362dd2406655?context=explore), [node-17.9.0](https://hub.docker.com/layers/node/library/node/17.9.0/images/sha256-c1336669570df673e44d5a2152eb4eff99f4c23bb3d19361c69f861b1bd5ffd3?context=explore)\\n* a ready-to-use image of a project like the [Docker Tutorial](https://hub.docker.com/r/docker/getting-started).\\n\\nChoosing your base image is important as it can help you reduce the amount of steps to get ready. If you chose Ubuntu as your base image for a Python project, you will need to write the instructions to install the Python version you want to install and your image will also come with many other packages that are preinstalled in the OS that you may not need for your projet. This is why Python images are available. It comes with Python already installed and some images (like slim images) also remove packages that aren\'t necessary for Python development. This strongly impacts the size of your image as shown here:\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![Python Docker images size comparison](./img/python-docker-images-size-comparison.png)\\n</div>\\n\\nThese are official Docker images and depending on which version you pull, you can see the size difference is quite noticeable.\\n* python\xa03.8 is almost 1GB.\\n* python 3.8-slim reduces it by 86%.\\n* python 3.8-alpine even goes down to <50MB.\\n\\nAlpine is not recommended for Python development as standard PyPi wheels don\'t work on Alpine and you have to compile them for every package, which can lead to additional research to properly achieve it. In some instances, compiling can also be very lengthy, like matplotlib that takes more than 25min to build:\\n\\n![matplotlib-build-alpine](./img/python-matplotlib.png)\\n\\nNobody ain\'t got time for that. \\n\\n### Efficient Build Instructions\\n\\nSo let\'s build our image using a small, ready-to-python image like ```python:3.8-slim```. We first need to install all our app requirements. So we add our ```requirements.txt``` file and install just like we would do locally :\\n\\n\\n``` Dockerfile\\nFROM python:3.8-slim\\n\\n# We place ourself in a dedicated folder\\nWORKDIR /app\\n# Installing requirements\\nADD ./requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt\\nRUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir\\n```\\n\\nAdding the file alone and installing the requirements right after allows you to create a layer that will be cached and you will not have to reuse this step in a future build. It is generally a good practice to use the cache when in development mode as you don\'t want to spend 10 minutes at every build of your requirements (you know it can take a while). The way Docker cache works is that by default it will reuse the highest unmodified layers.\\n\\n![docker-cache-example](./img/docker-cache-example.gif)\\n\\nHere are the commands that generate a layer and which you want to be able to cache and/or gather in a single instruction.\\n\\n* **FROM** creates a layer from the base image.\\n* **COPY** adds files from your Docker client\u2019s current directory.\\n* **RUN** builds your application with make.\\n* **CMD** specifies what command to run within the container.\\n  \\n[Source](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/)\\n\\nThen, we add the different required files with the *ADD* or *COPY* instructions. In our example, we need the python main code, the data and one image.\\n``` Dockerfile\\nADD streamlit_app.py  uber-raw-data-sep14.csv.gz  uber_demo.png /app/\\n```\\nTo access the app, we need to open port 8051 on the container. Otherwise, even if the app is running, it will not be accessible from outside the container by a browser. Instruction is :\\n\\n``` Dockerfile\\nEXPOSE 8051\\n```\\n\\nThe last instruction is the *RUN*, which tells Docker which command needs to be run at the start of the container. For us, it means starting the Streamlit app with the command ```streamlit run /index.py```, which in Docker syntax is:\\n\\n``` Dockerfile\\nCMD [\\"streamlit\\", \\"run\\" ,\\"/index.py\\"]\\n```\\n\\nThe final Dockerfile should look like this:\\n``` Dockerfile title=\\"Dockerfile\\"\\nFROM python:3.8-slim\\n\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\nEXPOSE 8501\\n\\nADD requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt\\nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt\\n\\nADD streamlit_app.py  uber-raw-data-sep14.csv.gz  uber_demo.png /app/\\n\\nCMD [\\"streamlit\\",\\"run\\",\\"streamlit_app.py\\"]\\n```\\n#### Run your Streamlit container\\nTo build your image, just run the command:\\n\\n``` bash\\ndocker build --tag ekilab-demo-container .\\n```\\n\\nOnce built, you can run the container with the command:\\n\\n``` bash  \\ndocker run -dp 8501:8501 ekilab-demo-container\\n```\\n\\nYour app should now be running and available at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).\\n\\n#### Live Reload\\n\\nThe issue with the current setup is that if you make a change to your app, you will need to rebuild and re-run the container to see the changes in your browser. We don\'t want to rebuild the whole environment, and to do that we will use the [volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) feature of Docker, and make it easy with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).\\nDocker-compose is a powerful tool to orchestrate multiple containers. But in our case, we will only use it to make our life easier. \\n \\n\\n```yml title=\\"docker-compose.yml\\"\\nversion: \\"3.9\\"\\nservices:\\n  ekilab-demo-container: \\n    build: .\\n    ports:\\n      - \\"8501:8501\\"\\n    volumes:\\n      - ./:/app \\n```\\nNow, you only need to remember one single command: ```docker compose up```. It will build your image, run it with the correct parameters and link it to the correct volume.\\n## Ship it to the Cloud !\\nIf you don\'t have an Azure account, you can create one for [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) and get 200$ of credits for trying out the platform. \\n\\n### Log into Azure\\n\\nLog into your account using the Azure CLI with the ```az login``` command.\\nThen, we will need a container registry. At Ekimetrics, we usually build our infrastructure using an Infrastructure-As-Code tool such as [Terraform](https://terraform.io). But for the sake of simplicity, let\'s use simple CLI\xa0commands to create our resources.\\n\\n### Container registry \\nThe container registry will store the different versions of our container. It can also be used to store other images. You can consider it as your private DockerHub.\\n\\n``` bash\\naz acr create --name ekilabhub --resource-group ekimetrics-demo --sku basic --admin-enabled true\\n```\\n### Linux App Service Plan\\nTo run our app, we need a Linux-based resource. This is what the App Service Plan offers.\\nB1 is a free instance that you can use for your small apps and Proof Of Concept.\\n\\n``` bash\\naz appservice plan create --resource-group ekimetrics-demo -n ekimetrics-lasp -l westeurope --is-linux --sku B1\\n```\\n\\nNow, we have several options :\\n* Option 1 - build the image locally and push it to the container registry\\n* Option 2 - build the image directly from the registry\\n* Option 3 - build and push the image from a CI/CD pipeline\\n\\nLet\'s try :\\n``` bash\\n# log into the container registry\\ndocker login ekilabhub.azurecr.io --username ekilabhub --password its4secr\u20act!\\n\\n# Option 1 - push the new Docker image to the registry\\ndocker push ekilabhub.azurecr.io/ekilab/ekilab-demo-container:latest\\n\\n# Option 2 - directly build on Azure Container Registry\\naz acr build --registry ekilabhub --resource-group ekimetrics-demo-rg --image ekilab-demo-container .\\n```\\n\\n### The Web App\\nFinally we can create the web app, based on our previously created App Service Plan, and by retrieving the image from the Container Registry.\\n\\n``` bash\\naz webapp create --resource-group ekimetrics-demo-rg -p ekimetrics-lasp -n ekilab-demo-app -i ekilabhub.azurecr.io/ekilab/ekilab-demo-container:latest\\n```\\n\\n## Let\'s Automate!\\nIt\'s all been fun but we don\'t want to do this every time we update the code. It would be easy to make a mistake and you may want to collaborate with other Data Scientists on your team and have their updates deployed without your help!\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![automate-all-the-things](./img/automate.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n### Bitbucket Pipelines\\nIn this example we are using [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://bitbucket.org/product/fr/features/pipelines) to automate these deployment steps but the logic is very similar in other tools such as [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/), [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build), [Gitlab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/introduction/), [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)...\\n\\nThe common concept behind these tools is to store all the instructions in a YAML file and execute them at every commit to a given branch. In our example, the master branch gathers the code that will be delivered to production.\\n\\n\\n```yml title=\\"bitbucket-pipelines.yml\\"\\nimage: python:3.8\\n\\npipelines:\\n  branches:\\n    master:\\n\\n      - step:\\n          name: Build and Push the image         \\n          services:\\n          - docker\\n          script: \\n          # build the image\\n          - docker build -t ekilabhub.azurecr.io/ekilab/ekilab-demo-container:$BITBUCKET_BUILD_NUMBER .\\n\\n          # authenticate with the Azure Container Registry \\n          - docker login ekilabhub.azurecr.io --username ekilabhub --password  $AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD\\n\\n          # push the new Docker image to the registry\\n          - docker push ekilabhub.azurecr.io/ekilab/ekilab-demo-container:$BITBUCKET_BUILD_NUMBER\\n      \\n\\n      - step:\\n          name: Deploying App to Azure\\n          script:\\n          # Install the Azure CLI\\n          - curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | bash \\n          \\n          # login with a Service Principal / store the credentials in a secured area\\n          - az login --service-principal --username $AZURE_APP_ID --password $AZURE_PASSWORD --tenant $AZURE_TENANT_ID \\n\\n          # Set the correct image version to the web app \\n          - az webapp config container set  --resource-group $AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP  --name ekilab-demo-app  --docker-custom-image-name ekilab-demo-container:$BITBUCKET_BUILD_NUMBER  --docker-registry-server-url ekilabhub.azurecr.io --docker-registry-server-user ekilabhub --docker-registry-server-password $AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD\\n\\n```\\n\\n## What\'s next ?\\n**Congratulations !** You should now be able to automate the deployment of your app to the cloud and focus only on updating its content without worrying about how to publish your updates. Now, you might need to have a scalable app to ensure it can handle high loads of visits. You could require tools like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/).\\n\\n### Alternatives\\nWe presented one of the workflow we are using at Ekimetrics, but it\'s not the only one !

The article pictures the current environment to eventually give some key elements to deploy such technologies at this level of management. Deploying ML or even simple data science solutions at this level of responsibility requires us to do a deep check of the possible consequences as a tiny mistake can turn into a major negative outcome.

While being technical, the key takeaway of this paper is the level of generality that we get for every domain: Perceivers perform well on texts, sounds, images on a wide variety of tasks with the same underlying mechanism. In addition, it is able to scale well on high dimensional data as it bypasses the quadratic comuting time required by a Transformer.

In order to make sure you control what people see and when they have access to it, development teams use environments to create \u201cstages\u201d of the app which they consider good for releasing.\\n\\nEach environment has its own unique purpose. There are different naming standards across the industry, although almost every process starts with a \'development\' stage and ends with a \'production\' stage. Here is a typical set of environments:\\n\\n- __Development environment__ : where data scientist/data engineers/software engineers actually develop the product. The end user doesn\u2019t have access to this environment which allows developers to try new features freely. \\n\\n- __QA environment / Testing environment__ : once a product is sufficiently mature to be tested, it is deployed to a new environment in order for testers to work on a stable version, while allowing developers to continue working in the development environment at the same time. The end user doesn\u2019t have access to this environment\\n\\n- __Production environment__ : where the product will be deployed after testing and made accessible to the end client. Every features should work when the product reaches this stage.\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/1_pbi.png)\\n</div>\\n\\nFurthermore, each environment should have its own database because in the same way that products evolve through development, databases also evolve: tables may be modified, added or deleted. Thus, the actual development process actually looks like this:\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/2_pbi.png)\\n</div>\\n\\nNow that you know __why__ you should use different environments when developing products, this article explains __how__ to do that in Power BI! \\n\\n\\n:::info  \\nIn Power BI, the product you are developing is a __Report__ and the environments are __Workspaces__\\n:::\\n\\n:::note Disclaimer  \\n- This guide supposes you have already developed a Power BI report using [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/) and published this report to a Power BI Workspace, accessible through the [Power BI Web Portal](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/fr-fr/). \\n- These assumptions will be stated again at the beginning of each Part, in Step 0 - (Baseline).\\n:::\\n\\n\\n## In Power BI Desktop, make your data sources dynamic\\n\\n### Step 0 - (Baseline) Have a Power BI report connected to hard-coded data sources\\n\\n\\nAs explained in the disclaimer, you should already have a report connected to data sources. Check out this documentation for more information about [data sources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-quickstart-connect-to-data) in [Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-data-sources). \\n\\nA typical report would have several tables in the pane Fields: \\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/3_pbi.png)\\n</div>\\n\\nAs a little foreshadowing and making sure we are on the same page, open the Power Query editor (by clicking _Home_ (Top Ribbon) \u2192 _Transform Data_ \u2192 _Transform Data_; then _Advanced Editor_) for one of your tables, and notice that all your data sourcing informations are hard-coded.\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/4_pbi.png)\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/5_pbi.png)\\n\\n\\nIn the last picture, we have the following information hard-coded:\\n\\n- The server is: dev-sql-01.database.windows.net\\n\\n- The database is: dev-db-01\\n\\n- The schema is: dev-rfd-crm\\n\\nThis hard-coded information is problematic as when we publish the report from one workspace to the next, the datasource will not change: we will always get our information from \u201cdev\u201d. What we need are parameters that change automatically as we change workspaces.\\n\\n### Step 1- Creating Parameters inside your reports\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the Power Query Editor, click the _Manage Parameters_ (top ribbon under the Home tab) \u2192 _New Parameter_. (Or you can click _Manage Parameters_ and select the _New_ button on the top to create a parameter). You can fill in this form and select OK to create a new parameter.\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/6_pbi.png)\\n</div>\\n\\nYou should create parameters for every variable that needs to change as you change workspaces. In my case, I needed to create 5 parameters:\\n\\n- One server parameter\\n\\n- One database parameter\\n\\n- Two schema parameters\\n\\n- One parameter called \u201cenv\u201d (with simply the options \u2018dev\u2019, \u2018ppd\u2019 and \u2018prd\')\\n\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/7_pbi.png)\\n\\n\\n### Step 2- Using the \u2018Advanced Editor\u2019 to use the parameters when connecting to your data source\\n\\nNow that you have created your parameters, use the following syntax to refer to your parameters when connecting to your datasource. \\n\\n```\\n#\\"ParameterName\\"\\n```\\n\\nHere is what the difference looks like for me. When the data sources variables are hard coded:\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/8_pbi.png)\\n\\nWhen the data sources variables use parameters:\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/9_pbi.png)\\n\\n:::note You made it through Part 1!\\nYou now know how to make your data sources dynamic inside your reports, you implemented it and pushed your report to your workspace.  \\n\\nAnd know you ask yourself: \u201c_But now, how can I make multiple workspaces and how do I change my report parameters automatically as I publish my report between workspaces?_\u201d \\n\\nCheck out Part 2 for the answer ! \\n:::\\n\\n## Part 2: In the Power BI Web Portal, create a deployment pipeline and assign parameters to each workspace\\n\\nIn order to use parameters, we will leverage Power BI\u2019s Deployment Pipeline feature. I encourage you to read Microsoft\u2019s official documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/deployment-pipelines-get-started) if you encounter any issues when working with Deployment pipelines as it is fairly comprehensive. \\n\\n### Step 0 - (Baseline) Have your Power BI report already published to a Workspace\\n\\nCheck out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0L1uXfefms) if you haven\u2019t already published your report to a Power BI Workspace (don\u2019t hesitate to watch at speed x1.75 :wink: ) .\\n\\n### Step 1- Creating a Deployment Pipeline from your Workspace\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/10_pbi.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n### Step 2- Deploy your report from the Power BI Development Workspace to the Power BI Test Workspace\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/11_pbi.png)\\n\\n### Step 3- Modify the Deployment Parameters to use the correct parameters\\n\\n- In the pipeline stage you want to create a dataset rule for, select __Deployment settings__.\\n\\n- From the Deployment settings pane, select the dataset you want to create a rule for.\\n\\n- Select __Parameter rules__, expand the list, and then select __Add rule__.\\n\\n- Select a parameter from the list of parameters; the current value is shown. Edit the value to the value you want to take effect after each deployment.\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/12_pbi.png)\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/13_pbi.png)\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/14_pbi.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n:::note  \\nNotice on the bottom of the last screenshot the following mention: \u201c_Rules will be applied when you deploy to this stage_\u201d.\\n\\nThus: once you have set the deployment settings for your report, you need to redeploy your report immediately to this workspace because the rules haven\u2019t been applied yet :sweat_smile: .  \\n:::\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nSo this is how to use different environments in Power BI in a nutshell. We went from one workspace with a hard-coded data source, to three separate workspaces where when a report is pushed from one workspace to an other, its data source changes automatically! \\n\\nDefinitely a lot of moving pieces here, but understanding theses concepts will make your workflow easier and less error-prone in the long-run ! \\n\\nI hope this information can help you on your Power BI journey!"},{"id":"/2022/02/28/newsletter_Feb-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/02/28/newsletter_Feb-2022","source":"@site/blog/2022-02-28-newsletter_Feb-2022.md","title":"Newsletter for February 2022","description":"Ekimetrics is pleased to release its second Newsletter of 2022!

It has challenged companies\' Supply Chain operations and highlighted that most companies could improve their supply chain management. Therefore, generating demand for enhanced forecasting capabilities.\\n\\nIn 2021, we had the opportunity to work with a French pioneer in manufacturing on this topic. We had to industrialize a solution for warehouse demand forecasting for more than 20,000 referenced products to improve overall Supply Chain performance. At the time, the existing solution was deprecated and not handling correctly erratic sales. \\n\\nTherefore, we had to create a new, more robust algorithm to help Operational Managers better allocate resources. This latter solution enabled a 60% accuracy improvement and was integrated into Operational Managers processes for decision making.\\n\\n\\n## An important asset for Supply Chain transformation\\n\\nDemand forecasting has an impact on different levers:\\n\\n- *Stock Management*: forecasting can drastically improve Inventory Management. Underproducing means losing revenue opportunities, whilst overproducing means selling your products cheaper or facing additional storage costs. Furthermore, with the return of activity after the first lockdown, suppliers are now bearing the brunt of building sites recovery, causing delays and creating supply instability.\\n\\n- *Resource allocation*: defining the best number of weekly working hours is not an easy task for operational managers, and anticipation is key to achieving optimal throughput.\\n\\n- *Product strategy*: demand forecasting also supports better handling of specific trends and product lifecycle. Hence, it helps warehouses anticipate and meet high demands, detect declined products and help marketing teams better understand customers\u2019 needs.\\n\\nMost importantly, Demand Forecasting has not become a hot topic because of the pandemic. Nevertheless, it brought to light the need of transforming Supply Chains and adapt to unexpected events. Indeed, global warming is increasing the frequency of natural disasters, which will test Supply Chains resilience (*have you heard of our AI4S offer?*).\\n\\n## How to build Demand Forecasting tool\\n\\n### What are we trying to solve?\\n\\nFraming the problem is key to ensuring Data Scientists go in the right direction. When discussing with Supply Chain managers, we understood they wanted to reduce their costs. Thus, improving resource allocation was the best lever to achieve their need. Clearly stating the business need allowed us to understand the problem and impacted the solution implementation.\\n\\n![Business Problem](img/article_supply/img1_v2.png)\\n\\n### Build and assess model\\n\\nBecause of the high number of products and their associated nomenclature, we used a decision tree algorithm (LightGBM). The business required a reliable mid-term forecasting tool within a short time lap and with limited team size, justifying the choice of a well-known and high-performance algorithm. Our solution is a 3-week forecasting tool with daily updates for all referenced products.\\n\\nThe ML pipeline we have built for this project is similar to many existing ones. Therefore, we will focus on how the business problem framed our solution. Still, this project was an opportunity for us to use [Kedro](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), which enabled Data Science teams to set up their ML data pipelines. Kedro had the advantage of visualizing your pipeline and structuring our code to ensure maintainability and reproducibility.\\n\\n![Kedro Pipeline](img/article_supply/kedro_2.png)\\n\\n\\n#### Modelling target\\n\\nWe want to optimize warehouse working hours to ensure clients satisfaction by delivering stores on time.\\n\\nWhat requires the most operational effort? Our client uses single order picking methods - meaning that pickers work on one order at a time. Thus, it is more time-consuming for a picker to prepare two orders of the same product rather than picking two times the product for the same order. Consequently, we focused on predicting the number of orders rather than the quantity ordered.\\n\\nNB: depending on how your supply chain operates, the modelling output would differ.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Modelling granularity\\n\\nOur client had a complex product hierarchy, meaning products can be aggregated at different levels. Demand forecasting at a product level gives higher flexibility when used on various business use cases, albeit not being the optimal solution for each one. Therefore, we aggregated ordered products at a higher granularity, to find the best balance between modelling accuracy and business need.\\n\\nWorking at a product level when having more than 20,000 products can be painful:\\n\\n- it means working with sparse time series (which isn\u2019t trivial when using decision trees)\\n\\n- manufacturing companies often deal with products turnover (because products are frequently improved), meaning you may lose the thread of which product is getting improved.\\n\\nTherefore, to optimize resource allocation, it was relevant to build a forecasting tool at a product category level, to combine similar products and avoid dealing with product\u2019s turnover. Analyzing sparsity at different granularities also helped us define the best modelling level.\\n\\n![Histogram](img/article_supply/img3.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Distribution of products\' sparsity (e.g. percentage of zeroes in orders). It is clear that most products have more than 90% of zeroes. \\n </div>\\n <br/>\\n\\nImportant learnings here were:\\n\\n1. Sparse time series are hard to predict\\n2. **It is best to go for a solution where the unit (time x product x localization) of forecasting matches the unit of decision making**\\n\\n![Predictions](img/article_supply/img4.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> We see how the coronavirus outbreak impacted the activity of our client during the first containment. Predicting this period is pretentious, but how can it help us reduce uncertainty in the future?\\n </div>\\n <br/>\\n\\n#### Modelling loss function\\n\\nModelling errors assess algorithms performance and help choose the model we will industrialize to better impact operations. However, when deploying a solution, we want to measure an error that reflects the current problem. Demand forecasting is not exclusively about being accurate on future demands but also about improving operations. Therefore, customizing errors metrics is a key part of machine learning development, allowing us to define the right balance between product demand (model accuracy) and product average preparation time. (focus on products with high preparation time).\\n\\nWe implemented the Weighted Root Mean Squared Scaled Error, using product average revenues in the last 6 months and product average preparation time.\\n\\n\\n![Prep Time](img/article_supply/table_2_v2.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Product B weekly preparation time is 400 min vs 200 min for Product A. Thus, higher accuracy on Product B is needed to reflect the operational needs.\\n </div>\\n <br/>\\n\\n### Evaluate business outcome\\n\\nBecause predictions are not always (never) linked to business outcomes, it is important to differentiate outputs (what are the predictions?) from outcomes (how will it impact the business?). This part was not implemented during the project, but we will briefly explain the methodology to give you a flavour on how it could be done.\\n\\nModel accuracy is a technical metric, so to quantify our ML model impact on operations we also need to estimate the predicted number of working hours. Comparing the number of predicted working hours with the realized working hours would allow measuring how much the algorithm is reducing costs.\\n\\n## Create a sustainable solution\\n\\n\\n### Implement a web app\\n\\nA core part of our solution was to implement an easy-to-use application for operations managers. It helped them access predictions in real-time, assess model past performance and define the optimal working hours needed. We used Streamlit for its ease of use and ability to create fast and intuitive applications whenever we are short on time. Consequently, we created a usable solution by communicating predictions, demand, and past errors at different granularities.\\n\\n### Add a feedback loop\\n\\nFinally, we created a feedback loop to enable the team to maintain, improve and sustain the solution. This concept is well explained in *Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence*, a book about what AI means from an economist perspective. They introduce a great concept they have named the Anatomy of a Task.\\n\\n![Anatomy of a Task](img/article_supply/img5_v3.png)\\n\\n\\nPredictions mainly impact people\u2019s judgement and decisions taken for action. It implies that algorithms are rather helpful for decision-makers than make the actual choice. In our situation, the predictions enable operational managers to take action on the number of pickers needed in the coming weeks. Improving modelling should help these managers be more accurate in their decision process. Giving Data Science teams feedback on how modelling affected outcomes is the added value.\\n\\nConsequently, we decided to create a clear feedback process with the operational managers. We made sure we could improve our forecasting model in a business manner rather than a statistical one. Our model not being perfect, the operational team\u2019s feedback on how our predictions are impacting their daily work will help us improve our algorithms and create a sustainable solution.\\n\\n\\n## Concluding and food for thought\\n\\nNew challenges will arise, and data will help supply chains tackle them. Creating a data-driven culture is key to useful and sustainable solutions. Creating state-of-the-art models is great, but a successful data science transformation is about creating impactful projects and delivering value throughout.\\n\\nThanks to this project, we learnt that:\\n\\n- Demand Forecasting is a great entry to improve Supply Chain operations, but the impact will be limited if not embedded in the full Supply Chain environment.\\n\\n- Demand forecasting is not about predicting the future, but about how data helps improve communication between teams.\\n\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"/2022/02/09/ekimetrics_implements_data_mesh","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/02/09/ekimetrics_implements_data_mesh","source":"@site/blog/2022-02-09-ekimetrics_implements_data_mesh.md","title":"Ekimetrics implements Data Mesh.

Although the vision for architecture is tailored to the culture of every customer, it is inspired by the practices we see as inspiring. This article describes one of these inspirational patterns that drive our projects\u2019 data architectures, the Data Mesh.\\n\\n \\n\\nI must introduce Ekimetrics first, we are 320 data scientists, with people and projects in Europe, in the US and in Asia. The goal of Ekimetrics is to become the most trusted partner in data science for business. Every consultant has their preferred topics: Vertical business expertise is the most represented, which is nice because that\u2019s where we derive use-cases from, then statistics / ml / advanced algorithms, then, equally represented, product development and data architecture and engineering. With a couple of colleagues, I lead that data architecture and engineering practice.\\n\\n \\n\\nData Mesh is a new framework that emerged recently, it is so deep and wide that we believe that it has the potential to influence data management for a whole decade.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe foundational papers, by Zhamak Dehghani ([zhamakd](https://twitter.com/zhamakd)) in 2019 are nothing short of fantastic (see articles [How to Move Beyond a Monolithic Data Lake to a Distributed Data Mesh](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html)  and [Data Mesh Principles and Logical Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-mesh-principles.html)). They address real-life challenges, they indicate how architectural and organizational aspects can be worked together and they really bring a new energy in data management. So, while I will cherry-pick some of the data mesh ideas that we are implementing today, I strongly encourage you to read both articles thoroughly. Said differently, what I describe below is only what is closest to our mindset and to our maturity on the projects, but there are many more insights in the original papers.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n## What is data mesh?\\n\\nData Mesh is a nice way to organize and grow data assets that serve business purposes. Data Mesh takes a limited number of simple ideas for data management, and all the terms used below are described in detail in the two foundational articles:\\n\\n- Ownership of data should be within the hands of the business teams,\\n\\n- Data boundaries should be created along business boundaries for data security, data sharing, cost management, etc., these are called Data Domains,\\n\\n- Sharing datasets inside and possibly outside the company should be simple,\\n\\n- Focusing on data products is a good approach to create value from data,\\n\\n- Federated governance is an approach that will scale where other cannot,\\n\\n- There is a harmonious way for IT, Data and Business teams to collaborate around data,\\n\\n \\n\\nWe see Data Mesh as a holistic way to organize data management. And since some cloud vendors have managed services that can help organize data like that, we have been working in that direction successfully with many organizations.\\n\\n\x3c!-- ![](img/data_mesh/image-20220207-172923.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Logical architecture of data mesh approach\\n </div>\\n <br/> --\x3e\\n\\n \\n\\n## Who is data mesh for?\\n\\nWe did not identify customer profiles where data mesh would not apply, so we believe it is ubiquitous. Medium and large organizations in financial services, retail, utilities, luxury, etc., both the references we have and the references we learn about prove it applies to all kind of companies.\\n\\n \\n\\nLimits are on the capability to challenge existing data assets and existing data culture, and it is not always the right moment to change these. That said, it should be possible to gradually transition from a monolithic data lake to a data mesh, by slowly introducing data domains.\\n\\n \\n\\nAnd a consultancy firm like Ekimetrics is the right place to be to participate in these changes !\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n## What is the relationship with GCP, Synapse or Databricks?\\n\\nWe see the latest generation of platforms is indeed very aligned with what data mesh requires, and GCP BigQuery, Azure Synapse and Databricks are good candidates for Data Mesh deployments.\\n\\n \\n\\nWith GCP as an example, it is easy to separate the cost of the storage in one project and the cost of the processing in another project and it\u2019s easy to leverage the data that one part of the company has prepared into a data product that is owned by another part of the company, without copying data, which is a data mesh idea. While this has been in BigQuery for a decade now, the framework now has a name!\\n\\n \\n\\nSuch solutions can now be built with GCP, Synapse and Databricks.\\n\\n \\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIf you are interested in building Data Mesh with us, please visit our [website (careers page)](https://ekimetrics.com/careers/) or our [page on Welcome to the Jungle](https://www.welcometothejungle.com/fr/companies/ekimetrics).\\n\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"/2022/02/07/building_datalake_part_1","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/02/07/building_datalake_part_1","source":"@site/blog/2022-02-07-building_datalake_part_1.md","title":"Building a datalake - Part 1 - Usable, Useful, Used, or how to avoid dataswamp and empty shell traps","description":"In this article, learn how to create your first datalake following best practices in order to make it robust, evolutive and central to your company\'s information architecture, as well as take advantage of the opportunities it presents.","date":"2022-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 7, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Datalake","permalink":"/blog/tags/datalake"},{"label":"Data Engineering","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-engineering"},{"label":"Architecture","permalink":"/blog/tags/architecture"},{"label":"Data Governance","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-governance"},{"label":"Data Mesh","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-mesh"}],"readingTime":16.485,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Emilien BOUCAUD","url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Building a datalake - Part 1 - Usable, Useful, Used, or how to avoid dataswamp and empty shell traps","author":"Emilien BOUCAUD","author_url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com","header_image_url":"img/blog/image_overview_article_datalake_1.jpg","tags":["Datalake","Data Engineering","Architecture","Data Governance","Data Mesh"],"draft":false,"description":"In this article, learn how to create your first datalake following best practices in order to make it robust, evolutive and central to your company\'s information architecture, as well as take advantage of the opportunities it presents.","keywords":["Data Science","EkiLab","Ekimetrics","Eki.Lab","Eki","Machine Learning","Artificial Intelligence","Data Science for business","Datalake","Data Engineering","Lakehouse","Data Architecture","Data Governance","Data Validation","Data Mesh","Azure","AWS","GCP"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Ekimetrics implements Data Mesh.

The main challenge is not to create one, but rather to do it right and avoid falling into the so-called __data swamp and empty shell traps__. In this article, we\u2019ll go through how you can create your first datalake following best practices in order to make it robust, evolutive and central to your company\u2019s information architecture, as well as take advantage of the opportunities it presents.\\n\\nIn this post, we\u2019ll be technology agnostic. The focus here is a smart architecture that will help solve functional and technical challenges, whether you\u2019re using Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, any other provider or even building & managing the infrastructure yourself.\\n\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nBefore talking about how to design a datalake, let\u2019s review what it is, why it\u2019s useful and the main aspects that will ensure its quality.\\n\\n### What is a datalake?\\n\\nA datalake is a global storage space allowing to interact with all data type: unstructured (e.g. text documents, images, videos), semi-structured (e.g. XML / JSON files), structured (e.g. SQL tables, CSV files). Data is extracted from all relevant sources, loaded into the datalake, then transformed into their use case specific target.\\n\\nA well-designed datalake is flexible and scalable, allowing it to handle the increase in data volume, velocity, and variety. Because a datalake stores raw data before transforming it, it is extremely useful for extracting potential value from the data for the future. By centralizing data sources into a global storage space, it helps data scientists and analysts explore data to generate new use cases and business insights.\\n\\n### Is building a datalake the right solution?\\n\\nThe goal shouldn\u2019t be to build a datalake for the sake of building one. A datalake is only the foundation, corner pieces in your larger data analytics and data architecture puzzle. Your goal should be to find a use case from which you can build a robust and evolutive foundation to your technical and functional architecture. Having a clear vision as to how your datalake can grow in a 2-year horizon, with new data sources and analytical use cases, is essential.\\n\\n### The data swamp and empty shell traps\\n\\nChasing the dream of a datalake that meets all current and future analytics needs or that unites all of your organization\u2019s stakeholders around a single vision is an excellent way to fall into the data swamp or empty shell traps.\\n\\nBy trying to collect all current \u2013 and future \u2013 data sources from the start, there is a risk that your datalake will become a swamp. When that\u2019s the case, due to unorganized, unvalidated or simply hard to exploit data, it can be incredibly challenging to make your datalake useable.\\n\\nYour first goal should be to analyze which high impact use cases will be used by your organization\u2019s stakeholders and target data for these specific use cases. Starting with the business needs instead of chasing a technical achievement, you can be sure that your datalake will be used and useful, instead of an empty shell: a good foundation but unable to attract your organization\u2019s stakeholders. Read more about how we can avoid missing out on business impact in [this whitepaper](https://ekimetrics.com/white-paper/data-science-industrialization-business-impact/).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## The foundation architecture\\n\\nLet us first establish the building blocks of your datalake. This foundation is the basis for logical separation of your data and use cases in the platform you\'ll be building.\\n\\nA datalake can ingest any type of data: from structured tables to unstructured files, whether ingested by batch or through streaming processes. Data will transit through four zones in sequence, from its raw form to fully processed for use cases, and from a technical to a business orientation.\\n\\n- Landing LAN : temporary zone for all sources. Once data is extracted, it transits through this zone and is dispatched into the next zone by validation mechanisms.\\n\\n- RAW (also known as bronze): data extraction pipelines will fetch data in the landing zone and validate it technically as well as functionally to make sure it is usable. This zone is the main storage component for all your data, and contains every extracted source, raw and untransformed, only with a concern for what is technically and functionally usable.\\n\\nIn landing and raw zone, data is organized logically by source: CRM, Point of Sales, WEB, etc.\\n\\n- Trusted TRD (also known as silver): in this zone, you\'ll find the output of your data pipelines. Here, data is deduplicated, cleaned, transformed, and aggregated for your target use cases. Data is organized logically by data domain (Marketing, Finance, Sales, Operations\u2026) and use case (Reporting, API exposition, AI training\u2026).\\n\\n- Refined RFD (also known as gold): this is the final zone for your data. It is the exposition layer for your use cases and is organized logically by use case.\\n\\nThese four zones are a representation of your data\'s journey through the datalake. From the refined zone, a serving layer can be added, taking shape in data marts, APIs, file exposition, etc. Your apps and users can then fetch or be sent data through this serving layer and make decisions that will give your data value.\\n\\n![](img/datalake_part_1/data_journey_through_datalake_full.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Data\u2019s journey through a datalake, from source to usage\\n </div>\\n <br/>\\n\\nYour data\u2019s journey from sources to serving layers is managed by pipelines, which are themselves managed by orchestrators. Pipelines describe how data is moved and transformed, be it with highly customized code or low code interfaces: in terms of concept, pipelines are close to ELTs (Extract, Load, Transform) mechanisms. Orchestrators are an ensemble of pipelines, defining parameters for each of them and specifying when and how they should be run: periodically, when an event triggers, using larger or smaller computing power, etc.\\n\\n:::note  \\nA sandbox storage zone and computing environment can be made available with access to some of your storage zones. That sandbox allows for exploration of data by data scientists and data analysts, motivating new use cases.\\n:::\\n\\nBased on this architecture, it all seems too simple: find a high value use case to start off the building process, then add new use cases and sources later. Following the design principles in the next section, it could in fact be that simple, all the while avoiding falling into the data swamp and empty shell traps.\\n\\n\\n## Usable and Useful through architecture and design\\n\\nWe\u2019ve gathered some best practices and design principles that work well to counteract the possibility of your datalake becoming messy or unused. We like to think of each of these best practices as serving a goal that is threefold: building a datalake that is __usable, useful, and used__ - what we refer to as our three \u201cU\u201ds. The first \u201cU\u201d is targeted towards the data swamp trap, the latter two towards the empty shell trap.\\n\\n### Usable through clear storage and pipelines architecture\\n\\nThe first step for building a usable datalake is to __make your storage and pipelines easy to comprehend__ for users as well as automated processes. Technical and functional separation for pipelines and storage is your first step in making your datalake understandable.\\n\\n- __Make it clear who does what in the datalake__. A use case is built on top of data, which needs to be collected: we\u2019ve found it best to separate data collection from its transformation from the start. Using at least different pipelines, and, better still, different scheduler resources will make understanding who (or which pipeline) is doing what much easier. One orchestrator for data collection pipelines, and other orchestrators for each data domain and use case theme \u2013 e.g. finance reporting, marketing CRM, sales exposition... This also sets up your datalake\u2019s functional architecture in a \u201cdata mesh\u201d-like manner, where __each data domain has its own identifiable perimeter__. \\n\\n![](img/datalake_part_1/pipeline_separation_full.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Separating pipelines among data domain orchestrators allows for a better understanding of who does what\\n </div>\\n <br/>\\n\\n- __Make it obvious where to find data in your storage__. We\u2019ve talked a little about Landing, Raw, Trusted and Refined data storage layers. Separating your data by source in the Raw/Bronze layer will help your users and transformation pipelines identify each dataset. Separating transformed data by use case in the Trusted and Refined layers will give a better understanding of the functional architecture behind the storage.\\n\\n- __Make it apparent which transformation or collection pipelines is responsible for which data__.\\n\\n  - Use identifiers such as date and time \u201cYYYYMMDD_HHMM\u201d for your pipelines and processes. Date and time is a great identifier for __understanding when data was transformed__ or collected. Sticking to them for your logging as well, you can make sure that monitoring your pipelines and exploring their results is as easy as possible.\\n\\n  - Inside your transformation pipelines, we\u2019ve found that using break points is highly useful. Writing a dataset\u2019s state after it\u2019s been cleaned, pre-transformed, etc\u2026 up until its final refined state will make debugging and understanding your pipelines much easier. Using names like *0_deduplicated*, *1_cleaned*, *2_calculated* to show breakpoints in your transformations allow for a better understanding of the data lineage of each use case, also helping exploration in the sandbox.\\n\\n\\n### Usable through data validation\\n\\nNow that your storage and pipelines architecture is understandable, your second goal is to __make your data usable__ so that the datalake doesn\u2019t immediately become a swamp with faulty and unchecked data.\\n\\nOne mistake to avoid is to consider that since a datalake can store any type of data, all data is good to collect, and you can figure out if it\u2019s usable and useful later. On the contrary: validating data from the get-go is essential. By having your data collection pipelines look at the structure and content of the data, you can make sure that your transformation pipelines will have a smooth time reading it down the line.\\n\\nHowever, this does not mean that you instantly delete any data that is deemed unfit for your use cases. We\u2019ve found that dispatching data into __rejected and validated subzones__ in the RAW/bronze zone is a good option:\\n\\n- A rejected subzone for any __data that will not technically fit__ your use case pipelines: faulty files with bad lines, wrong column count for structured data, corrupt zip files, bad encoding, the list goes on. Deciding which data to move to the rejected subzone ultimately depends on how it will be read by later pipelines.\\n\\n- We\u2019ve also seen cases where data needs to be __rejected for functional reasons__: data from a source can be sent to you even though you\u2019re not allowed to use it, or the data is technically readable but does not match with the sources you accept. In this instance, you can divide your rejected subzone into technical rejects and functional rejects.\\n\\n- Finally, any data that is technically and functionally usable can transit to the validated subzone. When a use case pipeline reads data, it will usually only read that data\u2019s validated zone. This not only ensures that your pipelines are robust and will not fail due to faulty or unexpected data, but it also allows for a stable data model to be built.\\n\\n\\n![](img/datalake_part_1/technical_functional_data_validation_full.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Technical and functional data validation guarantee a first level of data quality\\n </div>\\n <br/>\\n\\n\\nWhy keep rejected data, you\u2019ll ask?\\n\\nData that is technically rejected is useful for several reasons, the first one being that it is a good indicator of your sources\' quality, and allows you to communicate efficiently with your data providers. Secondly, technically invalid data at one point in time may be usable in the future, be it by adjusting your later pipelines to be able to read them or simply correcting the data as a one-shot fix.\\n\\nData that is functionally rejected is also useful, particularly in cases where it\u2019s from a source you\u2019re not sure you\u2019re allowed to collect. An additional subzone can then be a quarantine zone, where you would store data for which you need to check whether you can accept it in your use cases.\\n\\n:::note  \\nBy managing functional and technical rejections, your collection pipelines can be a powerful tool for your Data Steward and apply robust and monitorable governance at the datalake\u2019s entry point.\\n:::\\n\\n\\n![](img/datalake_part_1/datasources_to_breakpoint_full.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> From validated sources to a specific breakpoint in a run ID of a Use Case in a domain\\n </div>\\n <br/>\\n\\n\\n### Useful through a business driven design\\nWhat we mean by \u201cuseful\u201d - the second of our three \u201cU\u201ds, is that your datalake has to __serve a business use, while not limiting itself__ to the first identified use cases. This in turn means several things.\\n\\nThe first thing being the importance of starting from a business use case to then identify which data must be collected and transformed. Working from the business needs is always the winning strategy, especially for data science and datalake projects where it is easy to get lost in all the possibilities. Collecting data into your datalake is not an effortless task, especially following the aforementioned tips that help validate the data\u2019s usability, functionally and technically. Which is why the first step is to make sure that the data you collect is indeed useful to your target use case. Our article [\u201cCustomer Data Platform: Thinking Backwards is the Way to Go\u201d](https://ekimetrics.com/article-insights/customer-data-platform/) summarizes this business driven approach well.\\n\\nNow, in order to make the most of that data and not limit a source to the one and only use case, your collection pipeline should only be considering it as that: a source. This means that it is not the role of your collection pipeline to determine which data will be useful and remove all other data: delta calculation, replacing referentials, etc. is not up to the collection, but to the use case pipelines. Making the most of a datalake\u2019s scalability in storage and letting your use cases define what is useful to them in their own pipelines, you\u2019ll allow for more opportunities to use the underlying source down the line.\\n\\nOne last element to make your datalake useful is to anticipate changing functional parameters. Historical depth for your transformations, functional validation for your sources, ways to trigger custom runs\u2026 If modifying these parameters has a business or data management use, they should be included in the first iteration of your pipeline developments. In our projects, they have allowed us to be extremely flexible if a pipeline needs functional change and focus on adding new use cases and sources rather than tweaking the same pipeline over and over.\\n\\n\\n## Used through scalability of business impact\\n\\nStart small, allow it to grow : identify a single use case to automate and build your foundation architecture to host it. Using the best practices presented above you\u2019ll then be able to build on top of this robust architecture.\\n\\nThe target for your datalake\u2019s first use case should be for it to be __high impact, low time to value__. It must be the proof of value your businesses divisions need to invest more in the platform and should be an inspiration for other use cases. Once that use case is identified, along with the data it needs and a design for its transformation pipelines and exposition, you can start building it following the design principles presented above.\\n\\nThe steps below are a summary of how that first use case is built, but are also highly reproducible to build new use cases once your foundation architecture is in place.\\n\\n- Ingest a new source\\n\\n  - Technical validation: what are the rules that define whether this data is usable? Set up data structure validation and organize the source in an understandable manner.\\n\\n  - If the data source is highly likely to evolve over time, make sure that the collection and technical validation pipeline for this source is evolutive as well to anticipate future changes.\\n\\n- Build a new use case\\n\\n  - Functional validation: for this use case, what are the rules that define whether this data is useful? Once again, it is best to leave functional validation to your use case pipelines, as different use cases will have different requirements for what data they want (useful) and what they can legally use (usable).\\n\\n  - Same goes for how the data is used: delta calculation, targeting referentials, cleaning, etc\u2026 these steps should be part of your use case pipeline.\\n\\n  - Build transformations with break points inside the trusted data storage zone, up to the exposition layer (refined zone / gold), where it is fully ready to serve use cases. Which of these transformations is likely to change, and can you anticipate these changes by using simple configurable parameters?\\n\\n\\n![](img/datalake_part_1/data_storage_architecture_full.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> This data storage architecture makes it easy to add new sources and use cases\\n </div>\\n <br/>\\n\\n\\nThese first two steps will show your datalake\u2019s versatility. It is able to ingest any type of data, from unstructured to structured, streaming or batch. It is also able to transform it efficiently to feed use cases, due to the scalability of its computing power.\\n\\n- Build a new serving layer\\n\\n  - This final step will vary the most between use cases, as depending on your user endpoint, there might not be a unified way to serve refined data.\\n\\n  - Here you may need additional resources on top of your foundation architecture: an API management service, a database to efficiently serve structured data, a web service or container to display interfaces\u2026\\n\\nThat\u2019s it, your use case is fully functional on your datalake. Using the best practices we\u2019ve presented, the use case is robust, evolutive, scalable, understandable, and useful.\\n\\nOnce the foundation architecture is laid out and more use cases and sources are added, an argument can be made for a __core data model__. This model would be built by a single transformation pipeline that unifies deduplication / delta calculation, data cleaning, GDPR compliance transformations and preparation of highly used KPIs for your use cases. The core transformation should be considered as a use case pipeline: its job is to prepare data, saving on computing resources and providing a single source of truth for other use cases. It is also a great way to ease data exploration for data savvy users in the sandbox, allowing them to be inspired through use case agnostic and clean datasets. To maintain relevance, the core data model should be updated with new data sources as they are added, and new use cases using that new source should feed on the cleaned and prepared datasets.\\n\\n![](img/datalake_part_1/core_data_model_full.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> A Core data model centralizes all cleaning and pre-calculations, further simplifying the storage architecture\\n </div>\\n <br/>\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nStarting with the identification of a first high impact use case, you\u2019ve been able to build a robust and evolutive datalake. Following the design principles we\u2019ve reviewed, data and use case pipelines in your datalake are usable and useful. You are now able to show a proof of value for your datalake and grow it into a central data platform for your company.\\n\\nThe final U we could dive deeper into is \u201cUsed\u201d : your goal is now to maintain, grow and manage the datalake as a unified data platform, centralizing data and solutions for your business. An efficient and relevant datalake project comes with technical design challenges, some of which we\u2019ve talked about here, but also organizational challenges. By finding solutions for technical challenges, your datalake has shown its value and it is now essential to ensure its growth. As you coordinate with business divisions, you\u2019ll be able to draw a roadmap for the datalake and improve processes at an organizational level, using \u201cdata mesh\u201d-like functional architectures that allow for the best flexibility in use cases, growing your platform\u2019s relevance and enhancing data capabilities for your business.\\n\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"/2022/01/27/automl_benchmark","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/01/27/automl_benchmark","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-27-automl_benchmark.md","title":"Which AutoML platform to choose to start your Data Science project?","description":"How do Automatic Machine Learning solutions work?

With Automated Machine Learning (Auto ML) however, it can take days at most for business professionals & Data Scientists alike to develop and compare dozens of models, find insights and solve business problems quickly. But what is AutoML, how does it work and what are the most popular AutoML solutions out there? In this article, we will introduce the field of Automated Machine Learning by exploring some popular AutoML frameworks and trying to answer those questions around how to make the right choice for your use case.\\n\\n\\n## What is AutoML and why it is interesting?\\n\\n### Definition\\n\\n\\nSebastian Raschka, a well regarded American statistics professor, states: \u2018\u2019Computer programming is about automation, and Machine Learning is all about automating automation\u2019\u2019. If that\u2019s true then we can say that Automated Machine Learning is the automation of automating automation..! AutoML is a new optimization technique which aims at automating some of the core - but highly iterative - parts of the traditional modelling process in ML, in particular feature selection and model selection (including hyperparameter tuning and stacking). Let\u2019s take the example of a Decision Tree Algorithm. This algorithm has many hyperparameters (leaf, depth, split etc.) and browsing through all those hyperparameters can take days. An AutoML algorithm can intelligently explore all the possible parameters in order to find the best possible ML algorithm solving a given task. Some advanced AutoML algorithms can even choose between different features, create new ones and try different data cleansing scenarios!\\n\\n\\n\\n### How AutoML can help us?\\n\\n![](img/automl/Steps_DS_automl_3.png)\\n\\nThere are many steps in a Machine Learning project, with Model Training typically being one of the most time consuming. A standard project will focus on a Business Problem and will pass through Data Collection, Cleaning and Processing before the training phase. Model Training can then be cumbersome as we have to select an appropriate model family and to fine tune many times differents hyperparameters before building the analysis and deploying the model. This process can take weeks or months, but it seems that several steps can be automated using optimization algorithms and that is the goal of auto ML.\\n\\n \\n\\nIn a sense, AutoML is seen as a way to increase productivity, to allow the Data Scientist to focus more on defining the problem and the analyses rather than the models finetuning, to help avoiding errors, and on top of that, to democratize Machine Learning so that everyone can leverage its power. Its integration within ML Engineering environment allows to streamline pipeline and integrate specific training jobs, that allows to parametrize a model search completely from a simple configuration file.\\n\\n\\n### Overview of the main AutoML frameworks in the market\\n\\nFor this article, we have selected 7 well known AutoML frameworks, but many more exist in the market. Below is an overview of some of the types of Data Science problems these AutoML solutions can address. Among them two are open source: AutoKeras & H2o and the others are not: with DataRobot, Dataiku, Azure, GCP, and AWS SageMaker. (2 other open-source solutions AutoKeras and AutoGluon were studied, but these frameworks are not available on Windows.)\\n\\n![](img/automl/automl_platforms_3.png)\\n\\nMany of the AutoML solutions address different types of Data Science problems such as Sentiment Analysis or Computer Vision, however what is going to interest us for the rest of is article are the Classification and Regression ML problems.\\n\\n\\n## Exploring the capabilities of several AutoML solutions\\n\\n### Our methodology (Classification/Regression, datasets Kaggle)\\n\\nThe purpose here is to bring some knowledge in the field of **Automated Machine Learning** by **exploring some popular AutoML frameworks**. In order to establish a performance benchmark, we decided to test those frameworks on **common ML topics** like **Regression** and **Classification**. The idea is also to share our personal experience (and difficulties encountered) with those tools so that everyone can have an overview of each one these AutoML solutions.\\n\\nThese packages were benchmarked on two classical datasets available on Kaggle. We chose the **Titanic Challenge** ([Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview)) for the Classification problem and the **House Prices Challenge** ([House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/rules)) for the Regression problem. For each framework, we submitted predictions on the test set on Kaggle so that we can compare the results to the general leaderboard. What is interesting with this approach is that we were able to compare performance not only between each AutoML solution but also with individual performance.\\n\\n![](img/automl/methodology_automl_3.png)\\n\\n\\n### Our results\\n\\n#### Classification Problem - Titanic Challenge\\n\\n![](img/automl/titanic_challenge_details_3.png)\\n\\nThe Titanic Challenge is one of the most famous on Kaggle with more than 30,000 challengers. The objective is to have a model which will predict if a Titanic passenger survives or not on a small data set with 9 features and around 900 rows in the training set. The metric used for this challenge is the accuracy and the leaderboard we have downloaded from Kaggle is provided below.\\n\\n![](img/automl/benchmark_titanic_challenge_3.png)\\n\\nEach point represents a challenger with the performance of all tested frameworks noted, with ranking & accuracy plotted on the x and y axis. We found that Azure has the best accuracy followed by H2O and that the accuracy for all frameworks ranges within 73% - 80%.\\n\\n\\n#### Regression Problem - House Prices Challenge\\n\\n![](img/automl/house_price_challenge_details_3.png)\\n\\nFor the House Prices Challenge, the goal is to predict the final price of residential homes in the United States. This time the metric is the root mean squared error, which is a metric that tells us the average distance between the predicted values from the model and the actual values in the dataset. We have around 8000 challengers (less challengers than the Titanic Challenge) and the dataset here is bigger with more than 250 features and around 1400 rows in the training set.\\n\\n![](img/automl/benchmark_houseprice_challenge_3.png)\\n\\nWe can see that all frameworks did better than the baseline RMSE. Each of the tested models fall between 0.24 - 0.12 in terms of the RSME and H2O again performs the best among other tested frameworks.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\n### Which AutoML solutions to choose?\\n\\nIn conclusion, which AutoML to choose? When making our decision, the framework performance is important, but not all frameworks were in fact easy to use. Conversely, we spent a lot of time on some frameworks, because some of them were not as intuitive as expected.\\n\\nUser friendliness must also therefore be a major criterion to consider when you are wondering which AutoML to use. That\u2019s why, in order to consider the frameworks performance on both the Kaggle challenge but also the user friendliness of each solution (if it is easy to install it, to get familiar with the tool, to set up the experiment without errors), we built two further metrics to evaluate each AutoML framework and to compare them.\\n\\n- On the x-axis: we give the ease of use for each AutoML framework from 1 to 10 (10 being the best)\\n\\n- On the y-axis: we took the average ranking on the both Kaggle challenge (the closer to 0, the better)\\n\\n![](img/automl/final_benchmark_3.png)\\n\\nThe metric \'ease of use\' is somewhat subjective as it refers to our own personal experience. However, we would add that one of the goals of AutoML is to make Machine Learning accessible to everyone, so for someone with very little knowledge, it is interesting to see how accessible the differents tools are.\\n\\nWe found that:\\n\\n- The cloud solutions are more difficult to master especially if you\u2019ve never used cloud computing before. In fact, some time is needed to get familiar with all the different functionalities of cloud solutions like Azure, AWS or GCP as there are powerful and comprehensive tools.\\n\\n- Dataiku and DataRobot are very easy to use and very visual, with many icons. These interfaces are very clear and simple.  If you want to use an extremely easy-to-use AutoML tool, which can perform automated machine learning very quickly, DataRobot and Dataiku seem to be good solutions.\\n\\n- H2O works as a notebook so if you are familiar working on a Jupyter notebook for example, it can definitely be a good option and not too painful to use. H2O seems to be a very good choice in terms of performance and ease of use. Moreover, this framework has the advantage of being completely open source.\\n\\n\\n### Final thoughts, our key takeaways\\n\\nThis article tries to compare 7 majors AutoML frameworks. To do so, we introduced a methodology that considers the performance of each solution, but also their ease of use. What appears clearl is that AutoML can definitely be a good starting point to an ML project. In fact, for both the Classification and Regression problem, all the frameworks performed almost as well, even better sometimes than the baseline, just by using the AutoML functionality.\\n\\nHowever, it is important to remember that automatically generated pipelines are still very basic and are not able to beat human experts yet. As we could see on the different benchmarks from Kaggle, Data Scientists still perform better. A Data Scientist analyzes the hidden information inside data, extracts useful correlations, gives useful insights about the business that has created data itself and all these tasks cannot be fully automated.\\n\\n\\n## References\\n\\nTo read more about AutoML:\\n\\n[2019 | AutoML: A Survey of the State-of-the-Art | Xin He, et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.00709.pdf) \\n\\n[2019 | Survey on Automated Machine Learning | Marc Zoeller, Marco F.

Some existing systems also struggle to supply enough energy to the homes and businesses that are on the grid. \\n\\n\\nIt is estimated that 592 million people in Africa are living without access to electricity. Most of these people live outside of urban centers and therefore out of reach of the continent\u2019s electricity grid. Furthermore, the existing systems in many African countries even struggle to supply enough energy to the homes and businesses that are on the grid. \\n\\n\\nPay-as-you-go (PAYGo) solar technology has become Africa\u2019s most promising approach to handling the continent\u2019s growing energy problems. PAYGo users pay a small downpayment for a solar kit that provides up to eight hours of emission-free lighting every day, as well as enough energy to charge mobile phones and other devices. \\n\\n\\n\\nWith PayGo solar, residents are able to reduce their energy spending by up to 50%. \\nThe objective of this challenge is to help predict the next six months of payments for different customers. This will allow PAYGo distributors to provide appropriate services and customer support, ensuring that they can continue to provide these important devices affordably and efficiently to the benefit of people all over Africa. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Why do we organize hackathons?\\n\\nAfter a long period of COVID19 marked by an almost generalized working from home, we wanted to allow our teams to meet in real life with the coworkers they only saw in back-to-back Teams calls, and work together on an important cause.  \\n\\nWe love hackathons at Ekimetrics as they enable: \\n\\n- To federate teams;\\n- To make people that don\'t usually work together collaborate to drive innovation;\\n- To get some practical experience at tackling new problems far from our usual business topics.\\n\\n\\nThat is why we organize two big hackathons every year and bi-monthly coding challenge sessions, some of which you can find in open source on our [hackathons homepage](https://ekimetrics.github.io/hacks/). \\nFor this event, we were lucky enough to be able to carry it out in our office while respecting all sanitary recommendations.\\n\\n\\n![](img/Hackathon_Stories_1/Team.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n## How to organize a hackathon for your data teams?\\n\\nHaving organized a dozen hackathons internally and for our clients, and participated in many of them, we have consolidated our learnings into a set of best practices which we are happy to share with you to help you organize your own hackathon for your data teams:\\n\\n- **Finding a platform** - There are also platforms integrating many public hackathons like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/) mentioned above. This time, we chose to contribute to an existing hackathon - see section below about developing a hackathon platform. \\n\\n- **Choosing a meaningful topic** - Get involved in a project or a project that matters to you and your colleagues. It\'s important to work on a different topic than your daily work, but you need to have passion. \\n\\n- **Preparing the minimum starting pack** - Focus on the answer to the problem and spend time preparing notebooks and training tools to facilitate the handling of the subject by the teams and allow them to increase their skills on new technologies. Maybe also find a few data points and some interesting resources and references to.\\n\\n- **Making balanced teams** - It is essential to balance the teams taking into account their varying levels of expertise and seniority;\\n\\n- **Timing, Timing, Timing** - \u23f1 It is necessary to pace the flow of the event, to allow participants to get into the topic and also to propose dedicated sessions allowing for discussions with the organizers and help throughout the event;\\n\\n- **Setting the adequate duration** - \ud83c\udfc1 Ideally, hackathons last between 6 and 8 hours over an evening and part of the night in order to condense the challenge as much as possible while allowing the teams to take control of the issues at stake - to 2 days to have time to build a demo.\\n\\n- **Proposing a baseline** - \ud83d\udcbb Depending on the topic it can be very useful to propose one or more examples of models allowing to build a base line from which to iterate;\\n\\n- **Communication** - \ud83d\udcac It is necessary to provide a common discussion thread for all participants as well as private channels by teams;\\n\\n- **Fun** - \ud83c\udf7e Of course pizzas, beers, and other refreshments to keep a good energy level and especially a nice atmosphere throughout the competition;\\n\\n- **Letting the stage** - \ud83d\ude0e Finally, to showcase the night\u2019s work, we always plan a pitch session the next day to present the projects in front of Ekimetrics partners and founders.\\n\\n- **Rewards & gifts** - \ud83c\udf81 A nice option is also to reserve gifts for the winners if you can decide of a winner \\n\\n![](img/Hackathon_Stories_1/Image32.png)\\n\\n\\n## Do you need a hackathon platform?\\nIf it is not an open innovation hackathon, and depending on the topic and how the competition works, it can be interesting to have a main hackathon platform for participants to upload their results, test their solutions and compare with other teams. In this case there are multiple solutions to consider : \\n\\n- Using existing platform like [Zindi Africa](https://zindi.africa/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or [Driven Data](https://www.drivendata.org/) \\n- Build your platform adapted to your needs, in particular now you can easily use [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to build your own. See some examples below;\\n- Not using a platform, avoid building a new one if you can focus on human relations, and the platform does not add value to the competition or the innovation \\n\\nFor our different [hackathons](https://ekimetrics.github.io/hacks/), we developed the platforms we needed : \\n\\n##### Our main platform for custom hackathons where we can compute a score between teams\\n![](img/Hackathon_Stories_1/platform.png)\\n\\n##### The platform we developed on Streamlit for our Data Science Escape Game\\n![](img/Hackathon_Stories_1/platform2.png)\\n\\n\\n## What is our hackathon philosophy at Ekimetrics?\\n\\n\\nOur goal is not to become \\"Kaggle masters\\" to reach the highest score.\\nWe are always keen to put forward the double hat (technical and business) of Ekimetrics consultants in order to give meaning to the data.\\nThat\'s why during this challenge we evaluate the teams around three dimensions:\\n\\n- The performance of the models;\\n\\n- The quality of the data analysis, the insights, and the quality of the visualizations;\\n\\n- The overall strategy to tackle the problem, going back to the bigger picture - i.e. broader issuers such as sustainable development.\\n\\nOffering different types of sub-challenges within the same hackathon created great opportunities for *all* Eki employees (including members of the marketing, HR or finance teams) to integrate within a team, which helped create links between people who do not always meet on a daily basis - let alone work together.\\n\\n\\n## If you want to do it yourself\\n\\nThis hackathon is open, do not hesitate to participate [here](https://zindi.africa/competitions/sfc-paygo-solar-credit-repayment-competition).\\n\\n**Thanks to all the participants !**"},{"id":"/2021/12/22/cjc","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/12/22/cjc","source":"@site/blog/2021-12-22-cjc.md","title":"Customer Journey Clustering - How to use sequential modeling techniques to handle customer journey data","description":"Enrich your understanding of customer journeys through clustering using  image embedding, autoencoders and unsupervised learning.","date":"2021-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 22, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Clustering","permalink":"/blog/tags/clustering"},{"label":"Autoencoders","permalink":"/blog/tags/autoencoders"},{"label":"Churn","permalink":"/blog/tags/churn"},{"label":"Interpretability","permalink":"/blog/tags/interpretability"}],"readingTime":11.6,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Sabri Belli","url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Customer Journey Clustering - How to use sequential modeling techniques to handle customer journey data","author":"Sabri Belli","author_url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com","header_image_url":"img/blog/customer_journey.jfif","tags":["Clustering","Autoencoders","Churn","Interpretability"],"draft":false,"description":"Enrich your understanding of customer journeys through clustering using  image embedding, autoencoders and unsupervised learning.","keywords":["Data Science","EkiLab","Ekimetrics","Eki.Lab","Eki","Machine Learning","Artificial Intelligence","Clustering","Machine Learning","Neural Networks","K-means","Autoencoders","Churn","Shapley values","Interpretability","Data Science for business"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Hackathon Stories - Ensuring access to affordable and clean energy","permalink":"/blog/2022/01/06/hackathon"},"nextItem":{"title":"Introduction to Pyepidemics - epidemiological modeling in Python","permalink":"/blog/introduction-pyepidemics"}},"content":"\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/CJC/customer_journey.jfif)\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n<div align = \\"justify\\">\\n\\n## Enriching understanding of customer journeys through clustering\\n\\nAnalyzing customer website behaviour is an essential step towards understanding the ways in which customers perceive and interact with a brand\u2019s products and services. Methods for analyzing these online interactions have improved in sophistication and depth of insight offered in recent years meaning many traditional methods, such as journey mapping now fall short. Exploring Customer Journeys, whilst more complex, offers brands the opportunity to dive deeper and obtain more granular insights that can then be used to optimise and improve the experience of future customers.\\n\\nEmploying advanced methodologies is not only beneficial, but it has also become a necessary action for any business that wants to explore the increasingly complex customer journeys possible on modern websites. To provide some context to this challenge - when investigating this possibility for one of our clients, a global leader in the telecom industry, we quickly realized that given the number of possible actions on their website (about 1,760), performing standard analysis would be overwhelming. It would, in fact, raise the number of potential journeys to something of the order of 10<sup>4900</sup>. To put this number into perspective, the number of atoms in the universe is of the order of 10<sup>100</sup>. A simple method of analysing customer journeys is mapping. Essentially creating a visual representation of every touchpoint your customers have with you, creating a fluid timeline from how you initially engaged them to their first purchase and tracking the ongoing relationship.  \\n\\n> \u2026 it would raise the number of possible journeys to something of the order of 10<sup>4900</sup>. To put this number into perspective, the number of atoms in the universe is of the order of 10<sup>100</sup>.\\n\\n\\n## Advancing methodologies - Creating groups of similar journeys through image embedding, autoencoders and unsupervised learning\\n\\nMany businesses are adapting strategic models to emphasise customer-centricity and build up their online presence. Websites, therefore, become a powerful asset in understanding customer behaviour through the data that they generate. And analyzing this data becomes a potential source of insight to improve future interactions with the customer base, driving loyalty and higher conversion. Journey mapping and other traditional methods can provide fast and high-level customer insight, which can be an important first step in making use of this asset. However, they often fall short as the numbers of potential journeys increase exponentially. \\n\\nJourney clustering is a more advanced approach that uses algorithms to analyse all journeys by identifying groups of customers who interact with the website in similar ways. In doing so, we identify patterns in customer behaviour and begin to understand the motivations behind their actions.  This type of analysis can be used by businesses to personalise their websites and improve customer experience. Ekimetrics\' innovative approach specifically uses advanced encoding and machine learning methods, as well as clustering algorithms to make sense of the complex digital world.\\n\\nTo address this challenge our approach requires three key steps: \\n\\n1. Reducing the dimensions of our customer journey dataset\\n\\n2. Creating image-like representations of customer journeys; one image represents one customer journey\\n\\n3. Applying clustering algorithms on images to create groups of users with similar behaviours. For each cluster, we are then able to define a \u201cstandard journey\u201d.\\n\\n\\n### Step 1: Reducing the dimensions of our dataset\\n\\nAnalyzing customer journeys is a difficult task that can lead to memory allocation errors, primarily due to high data diversity. Even for less sophisticated brands, the number of parameters feeding into a customer journey analysis model can quickly become unmanageable due to the sheer size of data needing to be analysed. \\n\\nFor example, the following features can be tracked: the URL of the pages visited, time spent on one page, overall duration on the website, user clicks, and many more.  The temptation is to add as much detail as possible, but more variables create more noise and lengthening computation time. \\n\\nA solution to this problem is to identify the most relevant variables - with respect to the business question we want to answer - to take forward through feature selection, these metrics can then be aggregated into a single data structure. This process serves two purposes: firstly reducing the size and complexity of our inputs and ensuring the outputs are directed towards the business objectives and free of unnecessary noise.\\n\\n### Step 2: Encoding and creating images to represent journeys\\n\\nCustomer Journeys are path-dependent processes that describe customers\u2019 interactions with different touchpoints, for example, all actions on a website leading up to purchase. To analyse these relationships we need to manipulate datasets to represent online journeys but also translate them into something that can be easily interpreted and modelled.\\n\\nTo do this and ensure no information is lost we create a 3D embedding \u2018image\u2019 that merges all this data into a single structure through the following processes:\\n\\n- Touchpoints that a customer has interacted with are represented in columns\\n\\n- The order in which interactions happen is represented in rows\\n\\n- A vector describing the quality of the customer interaction (e.g. time spent/number of clicks\u2026)\\n\\n\\n![](img/CJC/Image_1.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Building our 3D embedding through an iterative process\\n </div>\\n <br/>\\n\\nThe 3 parts for building our 3D embedding highlighted in the figure above are:\\n\\n- Given n, the number of possible interactions on the platform, it is possible to build a vector V=(1,n) representing all actions that a customer can perform. At a particular stage t, it is possible to fill V with \u201c0\u201c or \u201c1\u201d depending on the customer\u2019s action: if the i<sup>th</sup> action has been performed at stage t, set V(1,i)=1 , otherwise V(1,i)=0\\n\\n- It is then possible to replicate this process at every stage of the customer\u2019s journey in order to build a matrix M(l,n) where every line l represents the lth action performed by the customer\\n\\n- Finally, adding an indicator of the journey\u2019s quality consists of replacing the 0 & 1 in the previous matrix, with a vector of values describing the interactions.\\n\\n\\n![](img/CJC/Image_2.png)\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Example of an image decomposition through RGB channels\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n  \\n\\n:::note    \\n\\n\\nColourized pictures can be decomposed into Red, Green and Blue monochromatic sub-pictures.\\nIn our case, we can draw a parallel between the different indicators describing the interactions and the colourized levels of an image.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### Step 3: Clustering customer journey \u201cimages\u201d to identify standard paths\\nIn order to apply a clustering algorithm first, we had to clean and apply pre-processing to our data. We then had to control the dimensions in order to keep the number of variables below a defined threshold (we chose ~log #observations). To achieve such control we used autoencoder neural networks.\\n\\nThe goal of such algorithm is to learn a semantic representation by extracting the relevant signals from a given set of observations. This is a dimension reduction method that enables us to perform non-linear transformations. In other words autoencoders enable us to turn our inputs into meaningful and compressed data by getting rid of the non relevant information.\\n\\n:::info\\n\\nPCA is another such dimension reduction method that performs linear transformations.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n \\n![](img/CJC/Image_3.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Using a convolutional autoencoder to compress customer journeys </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n The above figure shows how an autoencoder performs on a dimension reduction problem. First, the input signal is compressed over the blue layers to reach a compressed representation (represented by the Dense layer). The signal is reconstructed using the green layers to then give the output. **The goal is to have similar inputs and outputs while controlling the size of the Dense layer.**\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above architecture is different from the classic convolutional autoencoders (classic autoencoders involve a succession of convolution and pooling layers for the encoding part, and upsampling layers for the decoding part). The architecture we used relies on convolution layers, and on deconvolution layers rather than upsampling ones. Since deconvolution layers are trainable (meaning that they depend on learnable parameters), and upsampling ones are not, this architecture can learn more complex transformations than a classic convolutional autoencoder of the same depth.\\n\\n *This architecture is inspired from the one described in this [article about Deep Clustering](https://xifengguo.github.io/papers/ICONIP17-DCEC.pdf)*.\\n\\nOnce we had completed the dimension reduction, we need to apply a clustering solution on the compressed customer journeys. We then assigned each group of similar customer journeys to a representative standard journey.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n:::note **A word about clustering**\\n\\nA clustering process consists of building groups of observations (e.g. customer journeys) based on their characteristics. The key components of the clustering process are:\\n-  Building groups containing similar observations: we talk about intra-class variance minimization.\\n-  Building groups that are different from each other: we talk about inter-class variance maximization.\\n\\nClustering tasks rely on unlabelled data (such learning tasks are known as \u2018unsupervised learning\u2019).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Making the customer journey analysis easier to perform - taking advantage of a reduced number of journeys\\n\\nPerforming a clustering algorithm on Customer Journeys aims to reduce the complexity of the analysis through the creation of groups with similar journeys. The analysis is easier to perform as it becomes possible to focus only on the representations of each group, instead of analyzing every single path. This method drastically reduces the number of journeys that require our attention. It also becomes possible to highlight complex similarities or patterns when creating these clusters.\\n\\n:::info \\nOnce the clusters are created, each of them is assigned to a standard journey (e.g. when using k-means, these standard journey are called centroids).\\n:::\\n\\n![](img/CJC/Image_4.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Example of standard journeys </div>\\n<br/>\\n \\n  \\n\\nThe example above shows three of these standard journeys. We can already see some interesting information and differences between the clusters:\\n\\n- Customers in the Standard journey #1 group complete more actions compared to #2 and #3.\\n\\n- All three standard journeys have different starting and ending pages that correspond to the first and last rows in the pictures). By looking at these standard journeys, at a glance we can already spot some initial differences between the clusters. \\n\\nNote that deeper analyses can be performed on these journeys by looking at the non-embedded data.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Leveraging the Customer Journey Clustering - three ways of improving customer-centric strategy\\n\\n\\nWe believe that this solution has several uses to improving the way businesses operate by better understanding customer behaviour, forming a stronger view of the customer lifetime value, and improving the user experience and conversion rate.\\n\\n\\n### Improving websites\\nWe can use customer journey clustering to build a representative journey (using the centroid of each cluster), establishing the usual actions a user performs between touchpoint A (e.g. website\u2019s homepage) and touchpoint B (e.g. website\u2019s purchasing page). These typical journeys help gain a better understanding of the customers\u2019 experiences, allowing us to identify ways to improve the website. \\n\\nFor example, it will help brands optimise the groups of products shown at the top of a landing page.\\n\\n\\n### Building audiences\\nBy understanding the size and similarities between groups that interact with our website Customer Journey Clustering is also a way to create specific audiences. It then allows brands to tailor their activity to engage with these specific audiences, improving the overall experience. \\n\\nFor example, if clusters 1 and 2 appear similar, but cluster 1 has a higher conversion rate than cluster 2, then analyzing the behaviours from cluster 1 may help us understand how to better retarget cluster 2. \\n\\nThese insights also make it possible to redirect customers through an optimal action that will drive more conversions.\\n\\n:::note\\nWe could go a step further by creating customer conversion scores based on their journey. These scores could then be used to build an optimized communication strategy, leading to the next optimal action (i.e. increase or reduce media spend, depending on the score). \\n:::\\n\\n### Improve churn prediction\\nAnother use case to Customer Journey clustering is evaluating churn and when customers are likely to shop with a competitor or stop ordering from us. When journeys are associated to a churn score, it becomes possible to create a predictive model that can be used to identify the groups that are more inclined to churn.\\n\\nFollowing the training of the model, the learnings could be applied to the standard journeys associated with each cluster, outputting a global churn score per cluster. These scores can then be evaluated and compared to other groups to better manage expected orders and improve communications with at-risk customers. \\n\\n:::note\\nSince a churn predictive model such as this is trained on the 3D embedded customer journeys, one can expect it to be capable of spotting complex churn patterns involving huge sequences of actions, or time spent per action.\\n:::\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nAt Ekimetrics we believe that customer journey clustering can help enhance the customer experience and increase customer lifetime value. We also know that with customer behaviours changing rapidly, an approach such as this provides a flexible solution that can translate into actionable insights for any business. \\n\\nHowever, complexity is not always the answer.

We had the chance to work with many epidemiological experts, and as we went along we built a toolbox to facilitate our modeling of the current pandemics. We then put this toolbox in open source under the name **pyepidemics** to contribute to the community on this scientific discipline difficult to apprehend for Data Scientists but with obvious bridges facilitating innovation. \\nToday, with the resurgence of the epidemic in Europe, it seemed important to present this library more widely to democratize these analyses on a larger scale. \\n\\n- The library is available on Github at [this link](https://github.com/ekimetrics/pyepidemics)\\n- The documentation is available at [this link](https://ekimetrics.github.io/pyepidemics)\\n\\nThis article will serve as a synthetic presentation of what can be done with the library, please refer to the documentation for more details. Do not hesitate to post issues on Github and to contribute with new proposals, the development is still in experimental version. \\n\\n### Introduction to Pyepidemics\\nPyepidemics allows to simply create compartmental epidemiological models (also used in system dynamics) and to solve the differential equations that model the phenomenon. The different features implemented today are: \\n\\n- Creation of classical compartmental models (SIR, SEIR, SEIDR, etc...)\\n- Creation of COVID19 related model (with ICU and different levels of symptoms)\\n- Creation of custom compartmental model\\n- Implementation of policies (lockdown, tracing, testing, etc...)\\n- Calibration of epidemiological parameters on real-world data using Bayesian optimization\\n\\n### Installation\\nYou can simply install pyepidemics using the command \\n```\\npip install pyepidemics\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Introduction to epidemiological modeling in Python\\nThe images, the reasoning and the construction of the first bricks of the library are largely inspired by the exceptional work of Henri Froese with his series of articles on epidemiology, in particular the first article [Infectious Disease Modelling: Beyond the Basic SIR Model](https://towardsdatascience.com/infectious-disease-modelling-beyond-the-basic-sir-model-216369c584c4). \\n\\n### Compartmental models\\nAn epidemic is modeled with the different possible states for the population, for example: unaffected, immunized, vaccinated, symptomatic patient, asymptomatic patient, hospitalized, in intensive care ... Each state will be modeled with a compartment, and the population will transition between the different compartments according to parameters of probability and transition duration. In concrete terms, this means solving a system of differential equations as a function of time. \\n\\nFor example the simplest compartmental model is the SIR model (for the 3 states Susceptible - Infected - Removed). \\nIt is possible to write the following compartments with their transition:\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/introduction-pyepidemics/sir.png)\\n\\n</div>\\nThe transition parameters being given by : \\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/introduction-pyepidemics/sir2.png)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Building a SIR model with pyepidemics\\nThis section is detailed in this [tutorial](https://ekimetrics.github.io/pyepidemics/tutorials/quickstart/) which is also available directly on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ekimetrics/pyepidemics/blob/master/docs/tutorials/quickstart.ipynb). \\n\\n#### Using the bank of models\\nAs the SIR model is a standard model, you can find an already coded version in the model bank. We will learn in the next section how this abstraction is built to allow you to add details in the modeling. \\n\\nWith pyepidemics:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pyepidemics.models import SIR\\n\\nN = 1000 # Thousand persons\\nbeta = 3/4 # One person contaminates 3/4 person per day\\ngamma = 1/4 # One person stay infected for 4 days\\n\\nsir = SIR(N,beta,gamma)\\n```\\n\\nIt is then possible to solve the system of differential equations simply with the method ``.solve()`` (more parameters are available, see the tutorial quoted above : \\n\\n```python\\nstates = sir.solve()\\nstates.show(plotly = False)\\n```\\n\\nWhat is commonly called an epidemic \\"wave\\" is observed. \\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/introduction-pyepidemics/sir3.png)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n#### Reimplementing the SIR model\\nLet\'s now go into the internal workings of this abstraction to reimplement its operation in a few lines of code. Concretely we build a graph between the different states by detailing the transitions. Pyepidemics then translates this graph into a system of differential equations in order to solve it. \\n\\n```python\\nfrom pyepidemics.models import CompartmentalModel\\n\\nclass SIR(CompartmentalModel):\\n    def __init__(self,N,beta,gamma):\\n\\n        # Define compartments name and number\\n        compartments = [\\"S\\",\\"I\\",\\"R\\"]\\n        super().__init__(compartments)\\n\\n        # Parameters\\n        self.N = N # Total population\\n        self.beta = beta # How many person each person infects per day\\n        self.gamma = gamma # Rate of infection, duration = 1/gamma\\n\\n        # Add transition\\n        self.add_transition(\\"S\\",\\"I\\",lambda y,t: self.beta * y[\\"S\\"] * y[\\"I\\"] / self.N)\\n        self.add_transition(\\"I\\",\\"R\\",lambda y,t: self.gamma * y[\\"I\\"])\\n```\\n\\nSo it is possible to build any kind of compartmental model with this operation. You can see more complex examples in this [tutorial](https://ekimetrics.github.io/pyepidemics/tutorials/custom_model/).\\n\\n## Create a realistic epidemiological model for COVID19\\nIn the first section we saw how to build a SIR model, however we are far from being able to use this model to simulate an epidemic like COVID19 and for governments to be able to take actions using those analyses. For this we would need to:\\n- Have a more complete description taking into account the specifics of the disease states\\n- Take into account the mitigation strategies provided by governments\\n- Calibrate the model to describe the evolution of the epidemic as closely as possible\\n\\n### Build the right compartmental model\\nIndeed, the COVID19 is more specific than simply the 3 SIR states described above. During the year 2020, we used the following compartmental model inspired by the work of the Pasteur Institute and the INSERM (taking into account the different levels of symptoms, the incubation phase, and the passages in hospital or in intensive care)\\n\\n![](img/introduction-pyepidemics/model.png)\\n\\nYou can look in the library at the implementation of the ``COVID19`` model to see the implementation (very close to what has been described above for the SIR model, one of the strengths of pyepidemics). \\n\\n### Describe the mitigation solutions implemented (containment, testing)\\nSome parameters, such as the famous \\"R0\\", have varied enormously during the epidemic depending on behaviors (distancing, masks), policies (testing, lockdowns, vaccination), or variants of the epidemic. Thus, to create a realistic model, we need to take these variations into account. \\nWe will take the example of the first lockdowns to understand how to implement these variations with pyepidemics.   \\n\\nLet\'s create an evolution of the parameter ``R(t)`` according to the different lockdowns (during the first wave for example)\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pyepidemics.policies.utils import make_dynamic_fn\\n\\npolicies = [\\n    3.3/4,\\n    (1/4,53),\\n    (2/4,80),\\n]\\n\\nfn = make_dynamic_fn(policies,sigmoid = False)\\n\\n# Create our time-dependent parameter\\nbeta = lambda y,t : fn(t)\\n\\n# Visualize policies\\nx = np.linspace(0,100)\\ny = np.vectorize(fn)(x)\\nplt.figure(figsize = (15,4))\\nplt.plot(x,y)\\nplt.show()\\n```\\n![](img/introduction-pyepidemics/policies.png)\\n\\nAnd that\'s it! We can use this time-dependent parameter like we used a constant before. To see more complete examples and results, you can redirect to this [tutorial](https://ekimetrics.github.io/pyepidemics/tutorials/beyond-sir/).\\n\\n### Find the most appropriate parameters for calibration\\nFinally, in the previous example, as in those before, we chose arbitrarily the values of the different probabilities and transition times. But these are precisely what epidemiologists want to estimate. How does this work? Simply by testing different parameters until the solution of the compartmental model matches as much as possible the real evolution of the epidemic. Of course, we are not going to test all the combinations but rather : \\n- Start with an a priori on the different parameter values from the most recent epidemiological studies \\n- Use a Bayesian optimization algorithm to go through the parameter space efficiently without having to calculate everything. \\n\\nThese two methods are easy to implement with pyepidemics if we have a pyepimemics model with a ``.reset()`` method that recreates a compartmental model with the new set of parameters. First we create a parameter space to explore:\\n\\n```python\\nspace = {\\n    \\"beta_low\\":(0.01,0.4),\\n    \\"beta_high\\":(0.6,1.5),\\n    \\"I0\\":(0,100),\\n    \\"recovery_rate_asymptomatic\\":(1/8,1/2),\\n    \\"recovery_rate_mild\\":(1/8,1/2),\\n    \\"death_rate_hospital\\":(0.006,0.02),\\n    \\"death_rate_icu\\":(0.006,0.02),\\n    \\"recovery_rate_icu\\":(0.02,0.08),\\n    \\"recovery_rate_hospital\\":(0.02,0.08),\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThen we will simply use the method ``.fit()`` by giving as input a *dataframe* with the real values of the epidemic for the compartments for which we would have succeeded in obtaining data (in general the deaths and the hospital stays which are the most reliable). \\n\\n```python\\nmodel.fit(\\n    cases[[\\"D\\",\\"H\\",\\"ICU\\"]],\\n    space,\\n    n = 200,\\n    early_stopping = 100,\\n)\\n```\\n\\nThis step is not easy, takes time and often also requires iterations to change the definition of the compartmental model. But once solved it is what allows epidemiologists to follow the dynamics of the pandemic. \\n\\nMore details on calibration are available in this [tutorial](https://ekimetrics.github.io/pyepidemics/tutorials/calibration/). \\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWith this article we could introduce you to our epidemiological modeling library pyepidemics - simple modeling, flexible compartmental models, calibration, dynamic parameters, etc... The details of the different features are available in the library documentation. \\n\\nAs previously mentioned, this library is still under experimental development, we are still using it to model the 5th wave of the epidemic, in particular by adding compartments for vaccination - we will write an article on the modeling in the coming months. Do not hesitate to contribute to democratize this discipline to the Data Science community. \\n\\n## References\\nThese few references helped us greatly during the development of the library\\n- [Infectious Disease Modelling: Beyond the Basic SIR Model](https://towardsdatascience.com/infectious-disease-modelling-beyond-the-basic-sir-model-216369c584c4)\\n- [Expected impact of lockdown in \xcele-de-France and possible exit strategies](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.08.20095521v1) - by INSERM\\n- [Estimating the burden of SARS-CoV-2 in France](https://hal-pasteur.archives-ouvertes.fr/pasteur-02548181/document) - by Institut Pasteur\\n\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"/2021/11/03/tsp","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/11/03/tsp","source":"@site/blog/2021-11-03-tsp.md","title":"Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Reinforcement Learning","description":"A practical use of Reinforcement Learning and the Q-Learning algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem","date":"2021-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 3, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Reinforcement Learning","permalink":"/blog/tags/reinforcement-learning"},{"label":"Logistics","permalink":"/blog/tags/logistics"}],"readingTime":13.805,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Th\xe9o Alves Da Costa","title":"Head of AI For Sustainability","url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com","key":"theo.alves"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Reinforcement Learning","authors":["theo.alves"],"header_image_url":"img/blog/tsp.jfif","tags":["Reinforcement Learning","Logistics"],"draft":false,"description":"A practical use of Reinforcement Learning and the Q-Learning algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem","keywords":["Data Science","EkiLab","Ekimetrics","Eki.Lab","Eki","Machine Learning","Artificial Intelligence","Reinforcement Learning","Logistics","Supply Chain","Data Science for business"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Introduction to Pyepidemics - epidemiological modeling in Python","permalink":"/blog/introduction-pyepidemics"},"nextItem":{"title":"Deploying a Python Dash application for beginners","permalink":"/blog/dash-deployment"}},"content":"\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/tsp/tsp.jfif)\\n  \\n</div>\\n\\n## Summary\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nReinforcement Learning (RL) is usually applied for state of the art AI research and often make the headlines. Yet it still fails to deliver on concrete business topics. At Ekimetrics we strive to transfer AI innovations into the business world and Reinforcement Learning is a unbelievable playground to find disruptive solutions to complex real-world problems. In particular, there are many optimization problems that could be solved using RL.\\n\\nThe Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) has been solved for many years and used for tons of real-life situations including **optimizing deliveries** or **network routing**. This article will show a simple framework to **apply Q-Learning to solving the TSP**, and discuss the pros & cons with other optimization techniques. It\'s a perfect introduction for beginners in Reinforcement Learning and does not require heavy computational capabilities.\\n\\n> You can find all the code open sourced [here on Github](https://github.com/TheoLvs/reinforcement-learning/tree/master/5.%20Delivery%20Optimization)\\n\\n\\n## The Traveling Salesman Problem\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/tsp/tsp_example.png)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\nThe Traveling Salesman Problem (or TSP) is a typical optimization problem, where one has to find the shortest route to visit different cities. There are many different ways to solve this problem using discrete optimization techniques. \\n\\nLike many optimization problems, it\'s a NP-hard problem, which in short means that it\'s easy (in terms of speed) to solve for 5 cities, already impossible to brute force for 50. And almost impossible for most algorithms for  5,000 cities. Even for 15 cities, it\'s already 1 trillion permutations to compute (15!), there are optimization techniques that are more adequate : dynamic programming, branch and bound algorithms, nearest neighbors approximations, or ant colonies optimizations.\\n\\nFurthermore, the problem described here is too simple to describe a real-life delivery situation. It does not take into account multiple vehicle fleet, electric vehicle charging, time window constraints, capacity constraints, aleatory perturbations, etc... Hence, each variant of the TSP has its own optimization frameworks (in terms of variables and constriants), and the more you complexify the problem, the more difficult it is of course. That\'s why in practice delivery companies use combinations of those variants coupled with heuristics. The most advanced companies today add Machine Learning techniques on top of those algorithms, in particular to replace manual heuristics and better estimate in-context durations.    \\n\\nIn Python, the easiest way to get started with TSP and its variants is probably the great open source library [OR-Tools by Google](https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing). And if you want to learn more about discrete optimization, I can only recommend the great MOOC on *Discrete Optimization by the University of Melbourne* you can find on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization). \\n\\n## Applying Reinforcement Learning to the TSP\\n### Why bother using Reinforcement Learning?\\nIf it\'s already solved by classical optimization techniques, why bother using Reinforcement Learning? Well several answers: \\n\\n- It\'s fun and I personally love practicing RL. Curiosity is a great driver for innovation, and here I was really wondering if it could be applied for such a problem.\\n- RL is rarely used in real-life problems. Playing games or manipulating robot hands is awesome, but when it comes to business problems, RL often fails compared to simple heuristics or algorithms. At Ekimetrics, we always look for applying state-of-the-art AI research to the business problems we encounter in the real-world. \\n\\nHowever, Reinforcement Learning (in theory) would hold many advantages compared to classical optimization techniques : \\n\\n- **Offering a general framework for all problems**, indeed instead of tweaking the constraints and defining extra variables, you can change the reward, and defining a multi agent problem if needed for fleet optimization. Adding extra information like delivery time estimation is also eased if you can integrate the prediction algorithm with a similar ML techniques (e.g. Neural Networks)\\n- **Having a \\"live\\" decision making algorithm**. Because you would train a RL alorithm by making the next delivery decision at each stop, compared to \\"offline\\" optimization algorithms that study the problem with no unknowns, you inherently would be able to take different decisions if something happened during the experience, whereas you would need to recalculate with classical techniques\\n- **Being robust to unknowns and aleatory perturbations**\\n\\n### Transforming the TSP to a RL problem\\nBefore jumping into the TSP variants, let\'s take the most simplest version: *a delivery man who has to deliver 50 packages*. Between each stop can be defined a distance or a duration (or a more complex metric). \\n\\nTo transform it to a RL problem, we need to define: \\n\\n- **Agent**: the delivery man\\n- **Environment**: the different packages to deliver (and their destination) and the city where to navigate\\n- **States**: the location where the delivery guy currently stops \\n- **Actions**: at each location, the decisions to make (modeled as a Markov process) are: \\"where to go next\\" (or \\"which location do I chose next\\")\\n- **Reward**: Between two locations (states), how long (or how far) it is\\n\\n### Creating the routing environment\\nCreating a simple version of the environment is quite simple in pure Python. Indeed, you can store the position of the stops in a 2D virtual world as a numpy array or a Pandas DataFrame. Distances between stops can be calculated with an euclidean distance, but it could be complexified to account for durations or represent any distance/duration metric you would see in a routing network. \\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/tsp/env2.png)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n```python\\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import cdist\\n\\nENV_SIZE = 10\\nN_STOPS = 100\\n\\n# Creating the stops using numpy random points generator\\nxy = np.random.rand(N_STOPS,2)*ENV_SIZE\\n\\n# Computing the distances between each points\\n# Here use euclidean distances, but any metric would do\\n# This distance matrix can actually represent a time, a distance or something else\\ndistance_matrix = cdist(xy,xy)\\n```\\n\\nThen we want to define the starting position, the route, and the end position. Meaning that if we have to traverse A, B, C, D, E, possible routes would be for example ``A->C->B->E->D`` or ``B->D->E->C->A``. \\n\\nBy the way with 5 stops you have 5! possible routes or 120 possible routes. For 10 stops you already have 3.6 million possible routes. For 100 stops it\'s 10 to the 158th power routes. It\'s called the combinatory explosion, and that explains why this simple problem is impossible to brute force for a high number of stops. \\n\\nWe can visualize routes by drawing lines between each stop\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/tsp/env1.png)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nWe can also already imagine more complex and realistic situations. For example, one experiment I wanted to do was to stress test the RL algorithm to aleatory events. For example a known environment with unknown perturbations, like traffic. To model this interaction, we add a \\"traffic zone\\" inside our environment, where routes are much slower if taken. To account for the extra duration, we calculate the intersection points of the route within the \\"traffic zone\\" and measure the distance of the formed segment, we then use that distance weighed with a traffic intensity factor. \\n\\n```\\ni1,i2 = intersections\\ndistance_traffic = np.sqrt((i2[1]-i1[1])**2 + (i2[0]-i1[0])**2)\\nadditional_reward = distance_traffic * traffic_intensity * np.random.rand()\\n```\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/tsp/env3.png)\\n\\n</div>\\nNow that we have the overal idea, we have to design an environment object in Python to be fed to a Reinforcement Learning agent. We use the typical design framework inspired from OpenAI Gym:\\n\\n```python\\nclass DeliveryEnvironment:\\n\\n    def reset(self):\\n        \\"\\"\\"Restart the environment for experience replay\\n        Returns the first state\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        pass\\n\\n    def step(self,a):\\n        \\"\\"\\"Takes an action in a given state\\n        Returns:\\n            s_next: the next state\\n            reward: the reward for such action\\n            done: if the simulation is done\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        pass\\n\\n    def render(self):\\n        \\"\\"\\"Visualize the environment state\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        pass\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Designing the Q-Learning algorithm\\nBefore jumping into complex Deep Learning, I wondered if a simple **Q-Learning framework would work**. Basically with Q-Learning you want to evaluate a matrix mapping states, actions and rewards. Indeed to make a decision in a given state about the best actions to do, you would love to have an estimate if the decision was the best in the long term. This is represented by the Q values. \\n\\nIn our case, the rows are the different states (all the stops) and the columns the possible actions to take in this state, hence the next stop to go. The values are the estimated long-term reward you would get by taking this action. So, if you are found in a state A, you would like to take the action with the maximum Q value. \\n\\nFor our TSP problem for example, we would have a Q-Matrix of 50 by 50 if we have 50 stops. \\n\\nBecause we want to inform the routing algorithm with as much unbiased data we can find, we can actually initalize the Q matrix (also called Value function because it maps out states and actions to rewards - the values) with the distance matrix between all stops. Indeed, if you would not consider a long-term decision making strategy, you would apply a greedy one where you would chose the closest stop as a next destination. Yet it would definetely be better than random. \\n\\n```python\\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import cdist\\nQ = cdist(xy,xy)\\n```\\n\\nOk, but how to update those values and incorporate long-term planning? This is exactly the goal of the Q-Learning algorithm. \\nImagine you are delivering pizzas every day all across the city, you have an old GPS to help you decide the shortest route between your stops. But your city is much more complicated than what you and your GPS know. What would happen? \\n\\n- The first day, you would chose the closest stop first and then jump to the next closest one. You will quickly realize that it\'s not optimized. You should maybe have gone first to another neighborhood and deliver everything in the area before jumping to another one. \\n- So the next day, you commit to another strategy, armed with yesterday\'s experience. Definitely, looking ahead and avoiding single deliveries in remote areas even if they are closest is a better idea. But while you are exploring the best routes, you pass through the city center and get blocked into traffic that terribly slows you down. \\n- The 3rd day, you will try to apply the same general strategy, but definitely if possible you will never go through the city center, and try circling around the city to save some precious time. \\n\\nThis **trial-and-error behavior is basically how experience replay works in the Reinforcement Learning framework**. \\n\\nIf we code an agent abstraction, it could look like this:\\n```python\\nclass QAgent(Agent):\\n    def __init__(self,states_size,actions_size,epsilon = 1.0,\\n    epsilon_min = 0.01,epsilon_decay = 0.999,gamma = 0.95,lr = 0.8):\\n        self.states_size = states_size\\n        self.actions_size = actions_size\\n        self.epsilon = epsilon\\n        self.epsilon_min = epsilon_min\\n        self.epsilon_decay = epsilon_decay\\n        self.gamma = gamma\\n        self.lr = lr\\n        self.Q = self.build_model(states_size,actions_size)\\n\\n\\n    def build_model(self,states_size,actions_size):\\n        Q = np.zeros([states_size,actions_size])\\n        return Q\\n\\n\\n    def train(self,s,a,r,s_next):\\n        self.Q[s,a] = self.Q[s,a] + self.lr * (r + self.gamma*np.max(self.Q[s_next,a]) - self.Q[s,a])\\n\\n        if self.epsilon > self.epsilon_min:\\n            self.epsilon *= self.epsilon_decay\\n\\n\\n    def act(self,s):\\n\\n        q = self.Q[s,:]\\n\\n        if np.random.rand() > self.epsilon:\\n            a = np.argmax(q)\\n        else:\\n            a = np.random.randint(self.actions_size)\\n\\n        return a\\n```\\n\\nThe most important line is this one:\\n\\n```python\\nself.Q[s,a] = self.Q[s,a] + self.lr * (r + self.gamma*np.max(self.Q[s_next,a]) - self.Q[s,a])\\n```\\n\\nThis is the update rule in basic Q-Learning, where you increment the Q-value for each action in each experience replay (simulating a day of delivery hundreds of time) by the current reward + the reward for the best possible action you would take in the future. This recursive equation is a variation of the famous Bellman equation for Q value functions. \\n\\nNotice two factors: \\n- The learning rate ``lr`` control the learning speed (like in Deep Learning)\\n- The gamma factor ``gamma`` is the discount factor, and control long-term planning. Indeed if gamma = 0, you will only get the next action reward (your agent is \\"short sighted\\" only seeking current rewards), if gamma = 1 you will be more oriented towards the future rewards (above 1 it may diverge)\\n\\nThose two factors are our most important hyperparameters to tune during training (there are others like the epsilon variables defined in the initialization, if you are curious take a look at epsilon-greedy methods, a super simple way of tackling the exploration-exploitation dilemma in Reinforcement Learning)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Writing the training loop\\n\\nOnce we have define the environment, the Q-Agent and the update rules for the value function, we only need the final step: the training loop. We will apply **experience replay** to our poor delivery guy stucked in an infinite time loop. \\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/tsp/drstrange.gif) \\n\\n</div>\\n\\nEvery day, over and over, he will try to deliver our 50 packages, find the best routes and do it all over the next day. In Reinforcement Learning we call each day an **episode**, where we simply:\\n- Reset the environment\\n- Make a decision of the next state to go to\\n- Remember the reward gained by this decision (minimum duration or distance elapsed)\\n- Train our agent with this knowledge\\n- Make the next decision until all stops are traversed\\n\\n```python\\ndef run_episode(env,agent,verbose = 1):\\n\\n    s = env.reset()\\n    agent.reset_memory()\\n    max_step = env.n_stops\\n    episode_reward = 0\\n    \\n    i = 0\\n    while i < max_step:\\n\\n        # Remember the states\\n        agent.remember_state(s)\\n\\n        # Choose an action\\n        a = agent.act(s)\\n        \\n        # Take the action, and get the reward from environment\\n        s_next,r,done = env.step(a)\\n\\n        # Tweak the reward\\n        r = -1 * r\\n        \\n        if verbose: print(s_next,r,done)\\n        \\n        # Update our knowledge in the Q-table\\n        agent.train(s,a,r,s_next)\\n        \\n        # Update the caches\\n        episode_reward += r\\n        s = s_next\\n        \\n        # If the episode is terminated\\n        i += 1\\n        if done:\\n            break\\n            \\n    return env,agent,episode_reward\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Results\\n\\n### Q-Learning for a simple TSP\\n\\nWhen you start training and experiencing the same problem overtime, your agent learns about the environment, this is shown by the episode rewards values for each experience replay. \\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/tsp/training.png)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n- In the first phase, until the 400th episode, you are still exploring the different routes. Indeed with the epsilon decay method (with ``epsilon_decay=0.999``), you are taking random actions at each step. \\n- In the second phase, epsilon is lowering, and you start exploiting what you have learnt, and take less and less random actions to be more driven by Q values. \\n\\nWhat\'s tricky with epsilon-greedy methods, is that it kind of forces of the convergence. So did it work? Let\'s see. \\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n##### 50 stops experiment\\n![](img/tsp/training_50_stops.gif)\\n\\n##### 100 stops experiment\\n![](img/tsp/training_100_stops.gif)\\n\\n##### 500 stops experiment\\n![](img/tsp/training_500_stops.gif)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nIn each experiment, the algorithm converges quite fast to a seamingly acceptable route. After exploring a lot of options it not only gives one route but variations of the accepted strategy, which can already be interesting to find alternatives. \\n\\n### Q-Learning for a TSP with traffic zones\\n\\nNow that we have our environment, agent and framework defined, what\'s great with RL is that we don\'t have to change anything but the reward to model a different situation. Indeed because we tweaked the reward when you drove through a traffic zone, the agent will learn the same way to optimize his holistic route. \\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n##### 100 stops experiment with traffic zones\\n![](img/tsp/training_100_stops_traffic.gif)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\nEureka, the agent will avoid as much as possible the traffic zones\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n##### 500 stops experiment with traffic zones\\n![](img/tsp/training_500_stops_traffic.gif)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nWith more points, it\'s even more interesting, the agent will really circle around the traffic zone and prefer longer but faster routes. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Next steps\\n\\nI hope this simple experiment has highlighted how to apply (non-Deep Learning) Reinforcement Learning techniques to real-life problems. I haven\'t had time to benchmark the resolution against other optimization techniques (which I should have done I confess), but let\'s try to draw some pros and cons for the approach. \\n\\n##### \u26d4 Cons:\\n- Probably slower\\n- Definitely less accurate than a discrete optimization technique\\n  \\n##### \u2705 Pros:\\n- General framework to be updated in real-life situations (eg: the traffic) and extended to more complex problems\\n- Alternative routes are proposed\\n- \\"Online\\" decision making (meaning that you have an algorithm armed with a next-best decision recommendation system)\\n\\nNext steps is to extend the work to an even more global framework to account for multiple vehicle fleets, charging stations and more. The latter idea will require to use Deep Reinforcement Learning because states could not be represented as a matrix, and will probably be more difficult (impossible?) to train, but that\'s a topic for a next article!  \\n\\n## References\\n- All the code is open sourced [here](https://github.com/TheoLvs/reinforcement-learning/tree/master/5.%20Delivery%20Optimization) on Github\\n- OR-Tools [open source library](https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing) by Google\\n- MOOC on [discrete optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization) by the University of Melbourne on Coursera\\n- The timeless [MOOC on Reinforcement Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&ab_channel=DeepMind) by David Silver at Deepmind\\n\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"dash-deployment","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/dash-deployment","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-16-dash-deployment.md","title":"Deploying a Python Dash application for beginners","description":"Learn the basics of application deployment from simple examples on Heroku to creating Docker containers","date":"2021-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 16, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Industrialization","permalink":"/blog/tags/industrialization"}],"readingTime":4.7,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Th\xe9o Alves Da Costa","title":"Head of AI For Sustainability","url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com","key":"theo.alves"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"dash-deployment","title":"Deploying a Python Dash application for beginners","authors":["theo.alves"],"header_image_url":"img/blog/dash-deployment.jpg","tags":["Industrialization"],"description":"Learn the basics of application deployment from simple examples on Heroku to creating Docker containers","keywords":["Data Science","EkiLab","Ekimetrics","Eki.Lab","Eki","Machine Learning","Artificial Intelligence","Industrialization","Docker","Heroku","Python","Dash"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Reinforcement Learning","permalink":"/blog/2021/11/03/tsp"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome to the new Ekimetrics Tech website!","permalink":"/blog/welcome"}},"content":"<div align=\\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/dash-deployment/dash-deployment.jpg)\\n  \\n</div>\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## Creating a Dash application\\nBefore deployment, the first step if of course to create your own application. <br/>\\nYou can follow the guidelines in Dash official documentation https://dash.plotly.com/installation\\n\\n![](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/Manager/apps_data/dash-oil-and-gas/thumbnail_0a718df0-9ce7-11e9-8982-0242ac11004a.png)\\n\\n## Deploying your Dash application\\nhttps://dash.plotly.com/deployment\\nDash/Plotly offers a paid service to super easily deploy and manager your applications. Yet as most of it is open source, and you may want a simple thing for a prototype, you can simply deploy it in your own server.\\n\\nThen you have several options: \\n- Beginners - Deploy it on a simple Heroku server\\n- Advanced - Deploy it on a cloud server (AWS, GCP, Azure) with docker containers\\n\\n### Deploying on Heroku from GitHub\\nHeroku is the most simple server provider. It\'s even more simpleYou can create and deploy apps for free in just a few minutes. That\'s what we are going to do here : \\n\\n- Create your dash app, eg ``app.py`` (from Dash tutorial)\\n\\n```python\\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\\n\\n# Run this app with `python app.py` and\\n# visit http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in your web browser.\\n\\nimport dash\\nimport dash_core_components as dcc\\nimport dash_html_components as html\\nimport plotly.express as px\\nimport pandas as pd\\n\\nexternal_stylesheets = [\'https://codepen.io/chriddyp/pen/bWLwgP.css\']\\n\\napp = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=external_stylesheets)\\nserver = app.server\\n\\n# assume you have a \\"long-form\\" data frame\\n# see https://plotly.com/python/px-arguments/ for more options\\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\\n    \\"Fruit\\": [\\"Apples\\", \\"Oranges\\", \\"Bananas\\", \\"Apples\\", \\"Oranges\\", \\"Bananas\\"],\\n    \\"Amount\\": [4, 1, 2, 2, 4, 5],\\n    \\"City\\": [\\"SF\\", \\"SF\\", \\"SF\\", \\"Montreal\\", \\"Montreal\\", \\"Montreal\\"]\\n})\\n\\nfig = px.bar(df, x=\\"Fruit\\", y=\\"Amount\\", color=\\"City\\", barmode=\\"group\\")\\n\\napp.layout = html.Div(children=[\\n    html.H1(children=\'Hello Dash\'),\\n\\n    html.Div(children=\'\'\'\\n        Dash: A web application framework for Python.\\n    \'\'\'),\\n\\n    dcc.Graph(\\n        id=\'example-graph\',\\n        figure=fig\\n    )\\n])\\n\\nif __name__ == \'__main__\':\\n    app.run_server(debug=True)\\n```\\n\\n- Create a requirements file, eg ``requirements.txt``. You can use tools such as ``pipreqs``, ``pipenv`` or other environment managers to help you create the right file. \\n- Don\'t forget to add if not present the requirements to ``gunicorn`` in your requirements file\\n- Create a Procfile - it\'s a text file to help Heroku understand what file to be launched on the server. Write in it the following command. \\n  \\n```\\nweb: gunicorn app:server\\n```\\n\\n- As of ``2020-12-01``, Dash documentation is not totally correct when it comes to deployment on Heroku, you should correctly link the server variable in Python and the declaration in the ``Procfile`` :\\n  \\n```python\\n# Add following line in your app.py script\\nserver = app.server\\n\\n# Write the Procfile\\n# - app refer to the file name app.py\\n# - server refer to the variable name for the Flask Server \\nweb: gunicorn app:server\\n```\\n\\nAt the end your repo on Github should look like this:\\n\\n```\\napp.py\\nProcfile\\nrequirements.txt\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n- Deploy directly on Heroku from GitHub, you can follow the instructions below\\n\\n  - Create a new application\\n![](img/dash-deployment/deploy1.jpg)\\n  - Find the right name and server region\\n![](img/dash-deployment/deploy2.jpg)\\n  - Link via github, search for your repo and click on connect\\n![](img/dash-deployment/deploy3.jpg)\\n  - Deploy manually by clicking on deploy and choosing the right github branch\\n![](img/dash-deployment/deploy4.jpg)\\n\\n  - You can even set up a CI/CD process with auto-deploys by playing with the auto-deploy section\\n![](img/dash-deployment/deploy5.jpg)\\n\\n  - You are all set ! Your app should be live ! \\n![](img/dash-deployment/deploy7.jpg)\\n  \\n\\n\\n#### Problems you can encounter\\n- Having your app not at the root of the repo, you can use subdir buildpack\\n- Not linking correctly your server in the Procfile\\n- Having difficulties to link with a database \\n\\n\\n:::tip \\n\\nIf your app does not work, you can check in the logs why it failed : \\n![](img/dash-deployment/deploy6.jpg)\\n\\n:::\\n\\n\\n\\n#### What Heroku is doing under the hood\\nHeroku does a lot for us actually. It detects the technology behind the web server pushed on Heroku (Python, Node, etc...). Looks for a Procfile with instructions on how to launch the server. And knows many things on how to set it up. \\n\\nFor example for Python servers, it will look first to find a ``requirements.txt`` file or ``pipenv.lock`` file. For a Node.js server it will look at the ``package.json`` and the lock file as well.  \\n\\n\\n### Deploying with Docker\\nIf you want to better master what you are deploying. You may want to use Docker. It\'s actually universal and you\'ll be able to deploy it almost anywhere.<br/>\\nI just google searched \\"Dockerfile Dash\\" and found a suitable example as a template https://github.com/jucyai/docker-dash/blob/master/Dockerfile<br/>\\nHow does it work? You will setup a virtually empty server with nothing but python 3.9 and the application, i.e a Container. \\n\\n```docker\\nFROM python:3.9\\n\\nENV DASH_DEBUG_MODE True\\nCOPY ./app /app\\nWORKDIR /app\\nRUN set -ex && \\\\\\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\\nEXPOSE 8050\\nCMD [\\"python\\", \\"app.py\\"]\\n```\\n\\nUsing this Dockerfile you could be able to deploy anywhere from GCP to Azure or even Heroku. \\n\\n## Going further\\nTo better deploy, it\'s always interesting to learn more about what you are manipulating. Here, you have to know that Dash is a wrapper for other technologies put together, and in particular:\\n- Flask as backend and server\\n- React as frontend\\n- Plotly (the python library) for most graphs\\n\\nIf you want to be a Deployment ninja \ud83d\udc31\u200d\ud83d\udc64, you may find useful to learn more about Flask and webservers in general. And eventually learn about React. \\n\\n### Adding databases\\nWhat is recommended is to avoid storing your database in the same server. You should approach the problem with a \\"microservice\\" mindset, meaning that you should put your database on another server. \\n- Indeed, it means you have to do another deployment, maybe using Docker again to expose your database correctly\\n- But, it also decouple your app in production with the database, allowing you for more modularity (requesting the database in other platforms)"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-15-welcome.md","title":"Welcome to the new Ekimetrics Tech website!","description":"Welcome to EkiLab website - the Ekimetrics technology & innovation blog and website!","date":"2021-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 15, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Ekimetrics","permalink":"/blog/tags/ekimetrics"}],"readingTime":1.32,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Pierre Biousse","title":"Data Science Manager","url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com","key":"pierre.biousse"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome to the new Ekimetrics Tech website!","authors":["pierre.biousse"],"header_image_url":"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*yCcP_ZGS2mhlA9XnFFZDEw.jpeg","tags":["Ekimetrics"],"description":"Welcome to EkiLab website - the Ekimetrics technology & innovation blog and website!","keywords":["Data Science","EkiLab","Ekimetrics","Eki.Lab","Eki","Machine Learning","Artificial Intelligence"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Deploying a Python Dash application for beginners","permalink":"/blog/dash-deployment"}},"content":"<div align=\\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*yCcP_ZGS2mhlA9XnFFZDEw.jpeg )\\n  \\n</div>\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Welcome to our technology website!\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nWe have been working in the Data Science industry for 15 years and are now the biggest pure player in Europe with 250+ data profiles.
