One of the main challenge posed by such concept is how to maintain knowledge from past data into the model, avoiding catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, researchers propose an approach by leveraging prompt engineering. Using prompt Is very common in NLP as it tends to better fine-tune pretrained algorithms.
