Since the model has frequently encountered version numbers where 3.9 precedes 3.11, and commonly sees phrases like "version 3.9 or higher" (which includes 3.10 and 3.11), this pattern may have influenced its numerical reasoning. The model has thus learned this relationship between these numbers but struggles to discern that context matters and that by default the number 3.9 remains larger than the number 3.11.
