Our architectural and algorithmic improvements in this second iteration of the project can serve as a guide for building RAGs to serve other internal or external functions.")))}h.isMDXComponent=!0},45963:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/Figure2-d42c8ad97c424f09b9f4130f0dd1c617.png"},22427:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/Figure3-ea0b5664f2091822eb515dc84a0e7c4c.png"},82082:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{Z:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/Figure4-2ca52431c3766afa5b04d20a39de1f2c.png"}}]);
