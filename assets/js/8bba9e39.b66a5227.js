Foundation models are a type of AI model trained on vast datasets, enabling them to perform a wide range of tasks across different domains. These models often serve as the base for developing more specialized applications, making them highly adaptable and efficient. Generative AI, which includes foundation models, focuses on creating original outputs similar to the data they were trained on.\nOne of the first notable advancements in generative AI is the development of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), introduced in 2014. GANs consist of two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, that compete against each other in a manner similar to a game. The generator creates data samples, while the discriminator evaluates them, distinguishing between real and fake samples. This adversarial process continues until the generator produces data indistinguishable from real data.

This method maps scaled numerical values into a finite set of tokens (typically 4096), allowing the use of a transformer architecture based on the T5 encoder-decoder framework. The architecture processes input sequences with an encoder that embeds the quantized tokens and a decoder that generates future tokens autoregressively. This setup captures temporal dependencies using self-attention and positional encoding, without explicitly including external temporal features. Training utilizes a standard cross-entropy loss over token sequences, and inference involves iterative token sampling, which is then de-quantized to reconstruct continuous forecasts.
