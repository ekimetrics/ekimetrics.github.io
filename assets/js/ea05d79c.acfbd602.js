Instead of modeling the true generative function of Y, we are looking to model its derivative. This article was seen as a major change in how we can shift from a discrete model state to a continuous one.\nLiquid Time Constant Networks (LTC) were introduced in 2020 with a strong emphasis on the concept of hidden state in the model. In previous models, hidden state at time t is optimized according to the output at time t (maximizing the accuracy). In LTCs, hidden state is used both to predict the output, but also the next hidden state t+1. It means that at each time-step, you update your memory, according to what you saw, see and expect to see in the future. This application is particularly powerful when you need to generate data at a given horizon. If you want a quick deep dive in LTC you can follow the first link.

To make it brief and simple, RCNN takes Regions Of Interest (ROIs), which are little rectangle cropped from the image, fed to a Neural Network.
