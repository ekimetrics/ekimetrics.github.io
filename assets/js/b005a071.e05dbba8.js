Unfortunately, most papers studied here are not verbose on solutions against overfitting. Dropouts, weight decays seem commonly used and tuned; yet, Llava 1.5 ",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"#1"},"[1]")," avoids weight decay. Image augmentation is studied but not generalized: for instance, BLIP-2 ",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"#9"},"[9]")," benefits from random resized cropping and horizontal flipping, and Flamingo ",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"#8"},"[8]")," adds color augmentation; but PaliGemma ",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"#3"},"[3]")," just relies on label smoothing and dropout, without any data augmentation, which is proven to have no significant benefit. Llama-3.2 ",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"#5"},"[5]"),' goes further with a model soup: a "hyperparameter sweep" is run with multiple random data subsets and hyperparameter combinations, then the models are ranked, and finally, the weights of best models are averaged to obtain the final model.'),(0,i.kt)("h2",{id:"freeze-or-dont-freeze"},"Freeze or don't freeze?"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"We have understood that the most impressive VLMs, such as LLama 3.2 ",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"#5"},"[5]"),", have followed a quite long chain of training steps, with different task(s) at each step. We know that bimodal (vision-language) training steps follow the unimodal (language-only and vision-only) ones, that had previously been implemented to train the blind language model and the image encoder. But a question remains: how the ensure that during vision-language training, the VLM does not (catastrophically) forget what its two components (image encoder, language model) had correctly learnt?"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"The answer is in the ",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"freezing strategy")," chosen for each model. Freezing the weights of both the image encoder and the language model, while training only the adapter and new layers added when building the VLM, is a secure way to avoid catastrophic forgetting, and to reduce risks of overfitting on images: it was adopted in earlier papers (Flamingo ",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"#8"},"[8]"),", LLaMA-Adapter ",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"#10"},"[10]"),", MiniGPT-4 ",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"#11"},"[11]"),"). However, total freezing probably reduces the ability of the VLM to maximize its performance on new vision-language tasks. Therefore, more recent works have experimented, with success, various unfreezing strategies. An intermediate strategy is to freeze the 2 initial models during the first vision-language training steps, and to unfreeze them (or one of the two) in the last training steps, as explained for BLIP-2 ",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"#9"},"[9]"),", LLaVA & LLaVA-NeXT ",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"#1"},"[1]"),", CogVLM 1 & 2 ",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"#2"},"[2]"),". Some research teams go further: in LLama 3.2 ",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"#5"},"[5]"),", the image encoder is not frozen at all, whilst the language model is unfrozen after a few vision-language training steps.
