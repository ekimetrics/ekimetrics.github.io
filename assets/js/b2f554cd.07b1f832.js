Counterfactuals are powerful tools for uncovering actionable insights and enhancing model transparency by answering \u201cwhat if things had been different\u201d.  \\n\\nHowever, not all \\"what-if\\" questions are meant to change the outcome. In this post, we shift our attention to a different kind of hypothetical: the \\"even if\\" scenario: semifactual explanations [^1] [^2] (or simply semifactuals). These are hypothetical scenarios where some aspects of the input are altered, but the model\u2019s prediction remains the same. Rather than exploring what would have changed the outcome, semifactuals help us understand why the outcome didn\u2019t change, even under different plausible circumstances.\\n\\nThis subtle difference opens up new possibilities in explainable AI (XAI), particularly in areas like robustness testing, fairness assessment, and model auditing. Semifactuals can also be valuable for identifying optimized alternatives that might be more desirable or cost-effective, yet still lead to the same outcome.\\n\\nThrough this post, we\u2019ll define what semifactuals are, explore how they can be generated, walk through a code example, and consider their practical relevance, especially in domains like marketing. We\u2019ll also reflect on their role in the broader future of interpretable machine learning.\\n\\n\\n## I. What is a semifactual in Explainable AI (XAI)?\\n\\nIn the context of XAI, understanding how small changes in input features can affect a model\'s prediction is crucial for interpreting and improving the model. Semifactuals and counterfactuals are two related concepts that help us explore this.\\n\\nA semifactual is a hypothetical scenario in which we change some of the input features of a machine learning instance while keeping the model\u2019s prediction the same. In other words, a semifactual asks, \u201cWhat could have changed while still getting the same outcome?\u201d This contrasts with a counterfactual, which focuses on exploring what needs to change in the input features to get a different outcome. A typical semifactual explanation might sound like: \u201cEven if X and Y had been Z and K, you would still have been classified as P.\u201d\\n\\nJust like counterfactuals, semifactual explanations can be generated for both classification and regression problems. However, most of the existing work and practical use cases focus on classification tasks, where the model\'s output falls into discrete categories (e.g., loan approved or denied, churn prediction). The discrete nature of these problems makes it easier to explore meaningful alternative scenarios around the decision boundary.\\n\\nExample: Semifactuals in Loan Approval\\nLet\u2019s consider a simple loan approval example. Suppose we have a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on various features, such as:\\n- Income: The applicant\u2019s monthly income.\\n- Debt: The applicant\u2019s existing debt.\\n- Credit Score: The applicant\u2019s credit score.\\n\\nIf the model predicts that the loan application will be denied, a counterfactual might suggest that increasing the applicant\u2019s income by $10,000 or reducing their existing debt by $5,000 could change the outcome to approved.\\n\\nA semifactual, on the other hand, would focus on realistic, minor changes that don\u2019t change the outcome. For example: \u201cWhat if the applicant\u2019s income was $2,000 higher?\u201d or \u201cWhat if their debt was reduced by $1,000, would the loan still be denied?\u201d These adjustments help us explore the stability of the model\u2019s decision: is it robust to slight variations, or does it sit near a tipping point?\\n\\nAs mentioned, semifactuals can also be used for optimization. Imagine the model approves a loan application for someone earning $5,000 per month. A semifactual could explore whether the same positive decision could have been made if the applicant had earned $4,000 or had a slightly higher debt level. This allows decision-makers to identify less demanding, lower-cost, or more accessible alternatives that still lead to successful outcomes [^3]. In practice, this can reveal whether the model\u2019s threshold is unnecessarily strict and highlight opportunities for more inclusive or cost-effective policies.\\n\\n\\n### The Decision Boundary and Semifactuals\\n\\nIn machine learning, a decision boundary is the threshold at which a model\u2019s prediction switches from one class to another. In our loan example, the decision boundary might be the point where the model moves from denied to approved.\\n\\nBy adjusting input features slightly and observing that the prediction remains the same, semifactuals help us understand how close an instance is to that boundary. This is particularly useful for identifying which features are most influential and how sensitive the model is to them.\\n\\nThe image below demonstrates the decision boundary along with examples of semifactuals.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Semi_Factual/Picture_1.png)\\n  Source: Aryal, S., & Keane, M. T. (2023, August). Even if explanations: prior work, desiderata & benchmarks for semi-factual XAI [1]\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## II. Why Semifactuals Matter in Explainable AI\\n\\nMuch like counterfactuals, semifactual explanations bring a unique perspective to explainable AI. By exploring what could have changed while keeping the same prediction, semifactuals help address several key challenges in model interpretability, trust, and optimization:\\n\\n### 1. Robustness and Stability Insights\\n\\nTraditional feature attribution methods or counterfactuals explain why a decision was made or how to alter it. Semifactuals, however, answer a subtler but equally important question:\\n\u201cHow much flexibility exists before the model would make a different decision?\u201d\\n\\nThis is crucial for understanding the confidence and stability of the model\'s predictions. If a prediction remains unchanged across a wide range of feature variations, it suggests that the model is robust. Conversely, if the prediction flips with a small change, the decision may be fragile and could require further scrutiny.\\n\\n### 2. Optimizing Feature Profiles Without Changing Outcomes\\n\\nOne of the most compelling use cases for semifactuals is optimization, finding alternative input combinations that lead to the same outcome but in a more desirable or efficient way.\\n\\nFor example, in a marketing context (which we\u2019ll cover in more detail later), a campaign typically refers to a coordinated series of actions such as advertisements, email outreach, social media posts, and promotional events aimed at achieving specific goals like increasing brand awareness, generating leads, or driving sales. Suppose a campaign is already deemed successful based on metrics like conversion rate or return on investment (ROI). A semifactual could identify a different ad budget allocation or timing strategy that achieves the same level of success but at a lower cost or with better audience reach.\\n\\nThis ability to optimize while maintaining the same outcome is unique to semifactuals and highly valuable for:\\n- Reducing costs or resource usage.\\n- Discovering more efficient strategies.\\n\\n### 3. Enhancing Trust Through Confirmatory Explanations\\n\\nWhile counterfactuals are often used to show how a user could achieve a better outcome, semifactuals can provide confirmation that a decision wasn\u2019t made arbitrarily.\\n\\nFor instance:\\n\u201cEven if your income had been $2,000 higher, the loan would still be denied.\u201d\\nThis type of explanation helps users understand that the model\'s decision is consistent and not overly sensitive to small changes. This can be particularly important in regulated or high-stakes domains such as healthcare or finance, where justifying decisions is crucial for trust and compliance.\\n\\n\\n## III.\\tHow to generate semifactuals?\\n\\nGenerating semifactuals in machine learning involves identifying alternative instances that are meaningfully different from the original input while still yielding the same model prediction. This distinguishes semifactuals from counterfactuals, which aim to produce a different prediction through minimal input changes. \\nThe overall process of generating semifactuals typically includes the following steps:\\n\\n1.\\t**Instance Selection**\\n  Begin with a specific instance of interest for which the model\'s decision is to be analyzed. This is often a prediction where robustness, fairness, or optimisation is under review.\\n2.\\t**Constraint Definition**\\n  Determine which features are mutable and which should remain fixed, based on domain knowledge. Constraints play a critical role in ensuring that generated semifactuals remain realistic, actionable, and relevant to the problem context.\\n3.\\t**Search for Valid Semifactuals**\\n  Employ optimization or sampling techniques to explore the input space. The goal is to find alternative instances that (1) differ sufficiently from the original input to yield new insight, and (2) preserve the original model output.\\n\\n\\n#### Leveraging Existing Counterfactual Tools\\n\\nA practical and efficient method for generating semifactuals is to repurpose established counterfactual generation frameworks such as DiCE[^4] or MACE[^5]. These tools are typically designed to identify input modifications that alter the model\u2019s prediction. However, with a slight adaptation, they can be used to find inputs that instead preserve the original prediction, thereby producing semifactuals.\\n\\nOne straightforward strategy involves applying these frameworks in two stages. First, generate a set of counterfactuals. Then, use the same generator again, but now targeting counterfactuals of the counterfactuals selecting only those which return to the original prediction class. The resulting instances can be interpreted as semifactuals: they differ meaningfully from the original input but ultimately lead to the same decision, while being close to the decision boundary.\\n\\nThis two-step approach provides several advantages:\\n- Minimal adaptation required: It leverages existing software libraries and objective functions without requiring fundamental changes to the underlying algorithms.\\n- Enhanced diversity: Because the second step begins with counterfactuals that already differ from the original input, the final semifactuals tend to exhibit greater diversity.\\n- Improved plausibility: When using constraint-aware generators like MACE, the returned semifactuals remain within defined plausible bounds, offering explanations that are both realistic and actionable.\\n\\nHowever, this approach may also result in semifactuals that are further away from the original input in feature space, potentially raising interpretability trade-offs[^6]. The extent of this effect depends on the structure of the feature space, the constraints applied, and the generator used.\\n\\nIn the following section, we illustrate this concept with a Python implementation using MACE, highlighting how such a workflow can be integrated seamlessly into existing explainability pipelines.\\n\\n\\n## IV.\\tCode Example: Generating Semifactuals for Churn Prediction\\n\\n#### Applying Semifactuals to a Marketing Use Case\\n\\nIn this section, we explore how semifactual explanations can be applied to a real-world marketing use case: customer churn prediction. Churn describes the situation where customers cut ties with a company, wether by canceling a subscription, switching to a competitor, or ending a service agreement. Understanding why a customer leaves is important but equally valuable is knowing which customer traits could vary while still resulting in the same risk of churn. This can help identify hidden structural patterns, optimize engagement strategies, and test the stability of our model\u2019s decisions.\\n\\nWe use the [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn), a well-known benchmark from the telecom sector. \\n\\n#### What We Aim to Show\\nIn this experiment, we use semifactuals as a tool for feature optimization and model auditing, with two goals in mind:\\n1.\\t**Action Optimization**: Pinpoint which features can be tweaked without shifting the churn prediction, paving the way for sharper customer profiling and more precisely targeted marketing strategies.\\n2.\\t**Stability & Bias Testing**: Analyze the diversity and plausibility of semifactuals to assess whether the model treats different groups fairly, or if it consistently relies on sensitive or unstable features.\\n\\n\\n#### Applying Semifactuals to a Marketing Use Case\\n\\nIn this section, we explore how semifactual explanations can be used in a real-world marketing use case: customer churn prediction. In highly competitive industries like telecom, banking, or SaaS, understanding and mitigating churn is essential to maintaining a healthy customer base, especially since retaining an existing customer is often significantly more cost-effective than acquiring a new one.\\n\\nTraditionally, churn prediction models are trained to detect which customers are likely to leave, enabling companies to proactively engage them with retention strategies (e.g., promotions, improved support, personalized offers). But there\'s more to gain than just identifying who\u2019s likely to churn. Semifactuals can help uncover optimized alternatives within the same predicted outcome\u2014revealing, for example, how a customer could remain non-churn while reducing cost, simplifying their service plan, or aligning better with business goals. In this way, semifactual explanations support not only retention but also efficient resource allocation and customer experience optimization, all while maintaining the desired predictive outcome.\\n\\n#### Dataset: Telco Customer Churn\\n\\nThe Telco Customer Churn dataset includes a variety of customer-related features such as:\\n- Demographics (e.g., gender, age group, senior citizen status)\\n- Subscribed services (e.g., internet service, streaming TV, phone lines)\\n- Account information (e.g., contract type, payment method, paperless billing)\\n- Behavioral data (e.g., tenure with the company, monthly charges, total charges)\\n\\nThe target variable is binary:\\n- Churn = Yes: The customer has left the company.\\n- Churn = No: The customer is still active.\\n\\n#### What We Aim to Show\\n\\nIn this experiment, we use semifactual explanations as a tool for feature optimization and model auditing, with two primary goals:\\n1.\\tAction Optimization\\n  Identify which features can be changed without altering the predicted churn status to inform more robust customer profiling and design more efficient, cost-effective marketing actions. For example, if a customer is predicted to churn, semifactuals can tell us what aspects of their profile can vary while remaining in the \\"churn\\" class helping us explore more personalized interventions and optimize our positive outcome.\\n2.\\tStability & Bias Testing\\n  Analyze the diversity and plausibility of generated semifactuals to assess model stability. Are there customers whose predictions rely too heavily on sensitive features (like gender or age)? Do similar customers get different treatments due to small differences? Semifactuals offer a unique way to stress-test the model\u2019s fairness and consistency by observing how much change it tolerates before switching decisions.\\n\\n\\n#### Preprocessing Steps\\n\\n```python\\n# Import\\nfrom omnixai.data.tabular import Tabular\\nfrom omnixai.preprocessing.tabular import TabularTransform\\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\\n\\n# Create a Tabular object with features, categorical columns, and the target\\ntabular_data = Tabular(\\n    df,\\n    feature_columns=feature_names,\\n    categorical_columns=categorical_columns,\\n    target_column=target\\n)\\n\\n# Fit a transformer to handle encoding and normalization of the data\\ntransformer = TabularTransform().fit(tabular_data)\\n\\n# Get the class names from the transformer (e.g., [\'No\', \'Yes\'] for churn prediction)\\nclass_names = transformer.class_names\\n\\n# Transform the dataset into a NumPy array with processed features and target\\nx = transformer.transform(tabular_data)\\n\\n# Split the data into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test)\\ntrain, test, labels_train, labels_test = train_test_split(x[:, :-1], x[:, -1], train_size=0.80)\\n```\\n\\nThe dataset undergoes typical preprocessing, including:\\n- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., contract type, internet service)\\n- Imputing missing values, especially for fields like TotalCharges\\n- Feature scaling for numerical variables like MonthlyCharges and Tenure\\n- Splitting into training and testing sets\\n\\nThis step ensures that the data is correctly formatted for the model and free from formatting-related biases, enabling counterfactual tools to explore the feature space meaningfully.\\n\\n#### Model: XGBoost Classifier\\n\\n```python\\n#Import\\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier\\n\\n# Initialize an XGBoost classifier model\\nxgb_model = XGBClassifier()\\n\\n# Train the model on the training data and corresponding labels\\nxgb_model.fit(train, labels_train)\\n```\\n\\nWe train an **XGBoost classifier**, a tree-based ensemble model well-suited for tabular data with mixed variable types. XGBoost captures nonlinear relationships and interactions between features\u2014ideal for modeling the complex dynamics of churn behavior.\\n\\nOnce the model reaches satisfactory performance on the test set (using metrics like accuracy, precision, and AUC), we proceed to generate counterfactual and semifactual examples for customers predicted to churn.\\n\\n\\n#### Generating Semifactuals Using MACE (Twice)\\n\\n```python\\n#Import\\nfrom omnixai.explainers.tabular import MACEExplainer\\n\\n# Define the prediction function for MACE, using the model\'s predicted probabilities\\n# Input data is transformed to match the training format\\npredict_function = lambda z: xgb_model.predict_proba(transformer.transform(z))\\n\\n# Initialize the MACE explainer with the original dataset and relevant column information\\n# Initialize the MACE counterfactual explainer\\nmaceexplainer = MACEExplainer(\\n    training_data=tabular_data,  # Provide the training dataset\\n    predict_function=predict_function,  # Use the defined prediction function\\n    ignored_features=non_actionable_features  # Specify features that should not be modified\\n)\\n\\n# Select test instances (excluding the target column) for explanation\\ntest_instances = tabular_data.remove_target_column()[0:1]\\n\\n# Generate counterfactual explanations for the selected test instances\\nexplanations = maceexplainer.explain(test_instances, max_number_examples=1)\\n\\n# Retrieve the counterfactual explanation for the first data instance\\ncounterfactual = explanations.get_explanations(index=0)[\\"counterfactual\\"]\\n\\n# Remove the \'label\' column from the counterfactual DataFrame\\ncounterfactual.drop([\'label\'], axis=1, inplace=True)\\n\\n# Generate a new explanation = semifactual using the MACE explainer\\nexplanations_bis = maceexplainer.explain(counterfactual, max_number_examples=1)\\n\\n# Visualize the semifactual explanation for the first test instance\\nexplanations_bis.ipython_plot(index=0, class_names=class_names)\\n```\\n\\nTo generate semifactuals, we first apply **MACE** to find standard counterfactuals. Then, we **reapply MACE with a modified constraint**: instead of flipping the prediction, we constrain the optimization to maintain the original \u201cchurn\u201d outcome. This second pass generates semifactuals, feature variations that **do not affect** the prediction. In other words, we find nearby data points that are different yet still result in the same model decision.\\n\\n\\n#### Analysis of the Results\\n\\nWe generated semifactuals for several customer profiles to better understand the model\u2019s behavior. Each example shows how certain features can change without affecting the churn prediction, offering insights into model stability, feature sensitivity, and opportunities for optimization.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Semi_Factual/Table_1.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nIn this first example, the model predicts that the customer will churn (label = 1). The generated semifactuals include small, realistic changes such as a slight reduction in MonthlyCharges and toggling PaperlessBilling, yet the prediction remains unchanged. This suggests that the model\u2019s decision might be relatively stable and not overly sensitive to these features. While we can\u2019t definitively say which features the model relies on most, the consistency across these variations hints at a degree of robustness in this region of the input space.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Semi_Factual/Table_2.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nIn this second case, the customer is predicted not to churn (label = 0). Interestingly, the semifactuals show that certain feature changes such as switching the payment method or activating streaming services can increase the MonthlyCharges significantly (from $53.85 to over $69) without altering the model\u2019s prediction. This suggests potential for revenue optimization: the customer appears loyal enough pricier service options don\u2019t significantly riase their risk of churn. While we should interpret these changes with care, they hint at opportunities to adjust service offerings in a way that maximizes value without jeopardizing retention.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Semi_Factual/Table_3.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nIn this third case, we highlight the diversity of the semifactuals, where changes across multiple features such as switching the payment method, enabling streaming services, and modifying MonthlyCharges lead to a range of outcomes, yet the churn prediction remains unchanged. This flexibility indicates that businesses could experiment with various service configurations to enhance both customer satisfaction and revenue, without necessarily raising the risk of churn.\\n\\n\\n## V.\\tThe Future of Semifactuals and Explainable AI\\n\\nWhile counterfactual explanations have gained significant attention in the XAI community, semifactuals remain relatively underexplored. Most existing research and tooling such as DiCE and MACE has been restricted to counterfactuals generation and adapting them to semifactual use cases is still an emerging practice.\\n\\nThis presents both a challenge and an opportunity. On the one hand, current methods are not fully optimized to evaluate or generate high-quality semifactuals. On the other hand, the conceptual shift introduced bu semifactuals, emphasizing feature changes that leave the outcomes unchanges, opens up new pathways for understanding model robustness and the structure of decision boundaries.\\n\\nChallenges remain, particularly around the evaluation of semifactuals. Unlike counterfactuals, there is no clear-cut \\"flipped\\" prediction to verify. This calls for new metrics to assess their plausibility, proximity, and usefulness, especially when applied in real-world decision-making pipelines.\\nDespite those challenges, semifactuals hold great potential. They provide deeper insight into model behavior, offer a means to stress-test predictions, and foster user trust by illustrating how models behave under varied but outcome-preserving scenarios. As tools evolve to support semifactuals generation, and as more applications emerge, semifactuals are expected to play a central role in the next generation of transparent, accountable, and resilient AI systems.\\n\\n\\n### References\\n\\n[^1] Aryal, S., & Keane, M.

Generative AI is everywhere. Since the release of ChatGPT, public opinion has swung between fascination and anxiety. Some predict the end of humanity; others foresee the solution to all our problems. At Ekimetrics\u2014a mission-driven company and pioneer in responsible AI\u2014we saw, amid the noise, an essential need: to create the foundations of a calm, informed, and nuanced dialogue.\\n\\nFrom this vision came [CLAIR.bot](https://clair.bot/). Designed as an open, free tool to help everyone better understand AI, CLAIR also plays an internal role: it showcases our technological expertise and our commitments to frugality, open source, and digital sovereignty. Inspired by [ClimateQ&A](https://www.climateqa.com/)\u2014a chatbot providing sourced answers about climate change\u2014CLAIR tackles another major contemporary concern: artificial intelligence.\\n\\nOur ambition was twofold: to show that AI can serve the common good, and to offer an exemplary user experience from technical, ethical, and societal perspectives. All of this with a then-unique multi-agent vision.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Purpose and Audience: A Tool for Everyone\\n\\nCLAIR is for anyone curious or concerned about AI: students and teachers looking for reliable references; journalists exploring complex concepts; companies monitoring risks and opportunities; and everyday citizens who are often curious, sometimes anxious, and frequently lost.\\nThe idea is simple: ask any question freely and receive a rich, contextualized, and multi-perspective answer. To do this, we built an interface featuring four specialized AI agents. Ada, the technical expert, answers scientific and technological questions. Norma focuses on standards, laws, and especially the European AI Act. Sophia handles ethics, social sciences, and the philosophy of technology. Finally, CLAIR synthesizes the three perspectives into a coherent summary.\\n\\nEach response is sourced, explainable, and traceable. The aim isn\u2019t to deliver THE truth but rather a broad overview of viewpoints to encourage deeper understanding.\\n\\n## Design and Challenges: From Multi-Agent to Technological Frugality\\n\\nDeveloping CLAIR.bot was an open-air laboratory that led us to make bold choices. We adopted a multi-agent architecture\u2014one of the first of its kind in open-access\u2014where each agent answers the question in parallel, drawing on its own specialized document base. Each agent also uses an agentic retrieval approach: independently running multiple dynamic searches based on the question, allowing for richer answers.\\n\\nA major UX/UI effort ensured users could view four distinct answers without feeling overwhelmed. CLAIR\u2019s synthesis appears at the center, with the specialized agents displayed around it. We relied heavily on open-source technologies\u2014for front-end, search, and embeddings\u2014achieving excellent retrieval performance where open source often outshines proprietary alternatives. As for the language models, we initially used the best available, even proprietary ones, pending the emergence of more energy-efficient options.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/clair_anniversary/clair_capture.png)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nAlongside this, we implemented rigorous security measures: red teaming (including jailbreak tests), continuous monitoring (logs, latency, error rates, qualitative assessments), and even a CO2 tracker for every question asked, using [Ecologits](https://ecologits.ai/latest/). By design, CLAIR.bot is GDPR-compliant, collects no personal data, and offers full transparency about its sources and usage terms.\\n\\n## User Benefits: Accessibility, Responsibility, Clarity\\n\\nIn a landscape often dominated by monolithic AI answers, CLAIR.bot stands out by offering nuanced information. Its design ensures explainability: each agent cites its sources and links directly to the documents consulted. It remains fully free, accessible to all, and respectful of privacy, inviting users to reflect rather than simply consume a ready-made answer.\\n\\nFeedback has shown that CLAIR reassures, demystifies, and makes AI understandable without oversimplifying. It serves as a kind of popular education, matching the scale of 21st-century challenges.\\n\\n## One Year Later: Toward More Specialization and Frugality \\n\\nSince July 2024, CLAIR.bot has kept evolving. Ada now connects in real time to OpenAlex, accessing up-to-date scientific publications. Sophia will soon be able to consult an incident database to better assess social and ethical risks. For Norma, our roadmap aims to transform her into an online AI use case auditor, reasoning step by step through AI Act obligations.\\n\\nWe are also investing in fine-tuning smaller models (like Gemma 9B) to replace models that pose ethical or environmental concerns. Other efforts include automatically measuring bias, toxicity, and factuality\u2014combining human benchmarks with LLMs as evaluators\u2014and designing a modular architecture ready to host new specialized agents in fields like health, climate, or labor law.\\n\\n## CLAIR, a Compass in the AI Debate\\n\\nCLAIR isn\u2019t an endpoint; it\u2019s a beginning. In just twelve months, we\u2019ve shown that it\u2019s possible to build a different kind of AI: more responsible, more frugal, and more useful. CLAIR.bot remains a living project, constantly improving while staying true to its mission: revealing complexity, clarifying AI\u2019s stakes, and opening debates rather than closing them.\\n\\nThanks to everyone who designed, tested, critiqued, and used it\u2014and see you next year!\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"Blind_Language_Model","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Blind_Language_Model","source":"@site/blog/2025-07-23-Blind_Language_Model.md","title":"How to give sight to a blind language model","description":"Get a good technical understanding of how vision-language models are built and trained.","date":"2025-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 23, 2025","tags":[{"label":"GenAI","permalink":"/blog/tags/gen-ai"},{"label":"Generative AI","permalink":"/blog/tags/generative-ai"},{"label":"Deep Learning","permalink":"/blog/tags/deep-learning"},{"label":"Machine learning","permalink":"/blog/tags/machine-learning"},{"label":"Data Science","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-science"},{"label":"AI Models","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai-models"},{"label":"LLM","permalink":"/blog/tags/llm"},{"label":"Multimodal","permalink":"/blog/tags/multimodal"},{"label":"Object Detection","permalink":"/blog/tags/object-detection"},{"label":"Computer Vision","permalink":"/blog/tags/computer-vision"}],"readingTime":14.14,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Fran\xe7ois GUERILLON","title":"Multimodal Specialist","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/fguerillon/","imageURL":"/img/authors/francois_guerillon.jpg","key":"francois.guerillon"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Blind_Language_Model","title":"How to give sight to a blind language model","authors":["francois.guerillon"],"header_image_url":"img/blog/Blind_Language_header.jpg","image":"img/blog/Blind_Language_header.jpg","tags":["GenAI","Generative AI","Deep Learning","Machine learning","Data Science","AI Models","LLM","Multimodal","Object Detection","Computer Vision"],"draft":false,"description":"Get a good technical understanding of how vision-language models are built and trained.","keywords":["GenAI","Generative AI","Deep Learning","Machine learning","Data Science","AI Models","LLM","Multimodal","Object Detection","Computer Vision","VLM","Vision Language Models","Transformers","Attention"]},"prevItem":{"title":"CLAIR.bot: One Year of Responsible AI Serving Public Debate","permalink":"/blog/clair_anniversary"},"nextItem":{"title":"Under the Hood: Technical Blueprint of a GenAI-Powered ESG Due Diligence Tool","permalink":"/blog/Under_The_Hood"}},"content":"\x3c!-- import useBaseUrl from \\"@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\\";\\n\\n<link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"{useBaseUrl(\'katex/katex.min.css\')}\\" />\\n --\x3e\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Blind_Language_Model/optician.jpg)\\n\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\n_Note: this technical article is intended for data scientists and machine learning engineers having a good understanding of deep learning fundamentals and a basic knowledge of transformers and language models. If too long for you, just have a look at [conclusion](#conclusion) :-)_\\n\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nA notable trend we have observed in generative AI for the last few years is the development of **vision-language models (VLMs)** which are just special versions of language models with ability to receive one \u2013 sometimes, several \u2013 image(s) as a new input, in addition to the textual input. Most ambitious closed-weight large language models (e.g. GPT-4o, Gemini Pro) now include vision capacities. Many \u201cblind\u201d open-weight language models have been used as starting points for new VLMs having more and more image understanding skills, such as LLaVA [[1]](#1), CogVLM [[2]](#2), PaliGemma [[3]](#3), Phi-3-vision [[4]](#4), Llama-3.2 [[5]](#5) and Pixtral 12B [[6]](#6).\\n\\nAlthough the performance of VLMs across different vision tasks may be very irregular and sometimes disapointing (see for instance the [OpenVLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/opencompass/open_vlm_leaderboard)), they are a new field of hope for various use cases such as accessibility improvement through image captioning, automated web user interface coding from mockup images, zero-shot rich feature extraction from images for machine learning, for retrieval-augmented generation or product catalog automation...\\n\\nIn this article, we will not focus on potential use cases, but we will help you get a good (though certainly not comprehensive) and technical understanding of how vision-language models are built.\\n\\n\\n## Ingredients\\n\\nA common choice in reference papers we have gathered for this review (see last section: [references](#references)), to build a VLM, is to combine two already trained models: a blind **language model** and an **image encoder**.\\n\\nThe **trained language model** has a transformer decoder architecture, and has previously been trained in multiple steps, to be able to produce a relevant text, given an input text or sequence of texts, which may be an instruction, context data, chat history... Text generation is an iterative process: at inference time, the text is generated token per token (a token is a word or part of a word). At each generation iteration, the input of the model is made up of all prompted and previously generated tokens; each input token is converted to a token embedding (learnt during training, for all possible tokens in the token dictionary); then all token embeddings are analyzed and updated thanks to multiple transformer blocks. These blocks include **masked self-attention** layers, so that the model, to predict next token, can decide to pay different attention to any of the previous tokens.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Blind_Language_Model/language_model.png)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nThe **trained image encoder** has a transformer encoder architecture. As an input, it receives one image, which is divided into small patches (smaller images), as designed for Vision transformers [[14]](#14). These patches are gathered in a single sequence, and then go through a stack of transformer blocks which include a self-attention mechanism (attention between image patches at different positions in the original image). The output is a sequence of embeddings: one for each patch, which can be seen as a representation of the patch in the context of all other patches.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Blind_Language_Model/image_encoder.png)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n \\n\\n## Cross-attention vs. self-attention\\n\\nThe first question you may ask is: how to plug these two deep learning models together? Well, two alternative solutions are implemented, and you know them: **cross-attention** vs. **self-attention**.\\n\\n**Cross-attention**, is the now commonly used name for encoder-decoder attention, as defined in the original transformer [[7]](#7). It is a way for a transformer decoder, at each position of its input sequence, to selectively pay attention to some of the embeddings produced by a separate encoder: it is the normal connection mode between a transformer decoder and a transformer encoder. So it seems to be the most natural way to teach the language model (decoder-only transformer) to pay attention to the image embeddings produced by the image encoder. Flamingo [[8]](#8), OpenFlamingo [[13]](#13) and LLama 3.2 [[5]](#5) apply this cross-attention solution: cross-attention layers are inserted in the transformer blocks of the blind language model. Note that cross-attention is asymetrical: the representation of the image is not influenced by the text content.\\n\\nNote that with cross-attention between text and image, positional embeddings and self-attention masking strategies, previously defined in the image encoder and in the language model, are fully preserved. However, for interleaved texts and (possibly multiple) images, as in Flamingo [[8]](#8), a special masking strategy can be defined in cross-attention, so that text tokens may pay attention to an image only if the image is before that text token in the interleaved content.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Blind_Language_Model/cross_attention.png)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\n**Self-attention** between text tokens and image patches seems counterintuitive, since image patch embeddings and text token embeddings are two different sequences in two different representation spaces. Yet, self-attention is the most commonly used way to condition text generation with information from image: it is applied in BLIP-2 [[9]](#9), LLaMA-Adapter [[10]](#10), MiniGPT-4 [[11]](#11), LLaVA-NeXT [[1]](#1), CogVLM2 [[2]](#2), PaliGemma [[3]](#3), Phi-3-vision [[4]](#4), Pixtral [[6]](#6)... The \u201ctrick\u201d to make this possible is to add and train an **adapter** that converts the image patch embeddings into text token embeddings, which are inserted into the text sequence before the full sequence goes through all (or some) transformer blocks of the language model; different kinds of adapters have been experimented (see next section). After that conversion, the inserted converted embeddings are addressed just like text token embeddings, in the same self-attention layers and feed-forward (FF) layers of the language model; except for CogVLM [[2]](#2) models, which use dedicated self-attention and FF weights for sequence positions coming from the image.\\n\\nAdopting this self-attention solution requires making decisions on the image token embeddings which are inserted in the text sequence: which position to assign them for position embedding? Must they follow a causal mask as for text tokens (i.e. each token can only see previous tokens in self-attention computation)? Only a few papers mentionned here are explicit on their choices. For instance, CogVLM [[2]](#2) relies on a causal mask for image tokens, but for position embedding, all tokens from image share a single position identifier. In Pixtral [[6]](#6), the image tokens are treated identically to the text tokens, including RoPE-1D positional encodings for all tokens, and causal self-attention. On the contrary, PaliGemma [[3]](#3) avoids causal masking on image tokens. \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Blind_Language_Model/self_attention.png)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\n\\n## Vision and language alignment\\n\\nImage patch embeddings hold information in a representation space which is specific to the trained image encoder. Image encoders are usually trained on computer vision tasks, so they are not natively optimized for the job of providing useful information to a language model. So, how to ensure that the image encoder brings maximal useful information for text generation, for instance on various image-to-text tasks?\\n\\nFirst intuition to reduce the risk of misalignment (misunderstanding) between the image encoder and the language model is to choose the most appropriate image encoder. Almost all studied VLMs, except Pixtral 12B [[6]](#6), rely on a **\u201cCLIP-like\u201d image encoder**. CLIP is a pair of image encoder and text encoder, which were jointly trained to embed any image and its caption (text) to very close representations in a same representation space. Therefore, we can consider that the image patch embeddings produced by CLIP image encoder contain almost the same information as would contain a good caption of the image. CLIP original paper [[12]](#12) has inspired other scientific works based on the same image-text contrastive learning principle: we call them \u201cCLIP-like\u201d. With this training recipe, which \u201caligns\u201d image representation and text representation, the image representation of CLIP-like models is expected to be more easily understood by a language model, or more easily convertible to text token embeddings.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Blind_Language_Model/clip.png)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nSecond intuition is that **the image representation must be adapted to tasks with vision during VLM training**, not only in VLMs based on self-attention (where an adapter is required), but also in those based on cross-attention between text and image. This adaptation principle is generalized; yet, adaptation strategy is very different between papers. In some earlier works such as BLIP-2 [[9]](#9) and MiniGPT-4 [[11]](#11), a complex adapter (named \u201cQ-Former\u201d) is trained alone, during dedicated training steps (including on image-text matching and image-text contrastive training tasks), to convert the output of the image encoder into a new representation, fully optimized for text models. Other and more recent papers choose a simpler adapter, from a (still complex) Perceiver resampler in Flamingo [[8]](#8), to a classical multi-layer perceptron in LLaVA-NeXT [[1]](#1), CogVLM2 [[2]](#2) and Pixtral 12B [[6]](#6), or even a mere linear projection in LLaVA [[1]](#1), LLaMA-Adapter [[10]](#10) and PaliGemma [[3]](#3).\\n\\nAs for LLama 3.2 [[5]](#5), it relies on a different adaptation method: new trainable gated (i.e. inactivated before training) self-attention layers are inserted inside the image encoder, and progressively activated and trained during training on vision-language tasks.\\n\\n\\n## Train, train, and train again\\n\\nOkay ladies and gentlemen, we have solved the architecture questions: our language model is now fully connected to the trained image encoder. Now, how to fine-tune this vision-language model to ensure it can satisfy users on various image-text tasks, as if the language model had gained general vision abilities?\\n\\nWell, the solutions implemented in our reference papers are widely inspired from state-of-the-art language model training strategies. The principle is to design and implement a path of various training tasks, starting with the simpler ones, and then jumping to more complex jobs.\\n\\nMore precisely, here are the most common or interesting **supervised vision-language training tasks** (or task families) for VLMs. Note that all of them just aim at improving next text token prediction:\\n\\n* **Image captioning**: used for most VLMs, such as BLIP-2 [[9]](#9), LLaMA-Adapter [[10]](#10), LLaVA & LLaVA-NeXT [[1]](#1), CogVLM 1 & 2 [[2]](#2), PaliGemma [[3]](#3), Phi-3-vision [[4]](#4), LLama 3.2 [[5]](#5).\\n\\n* **Optical character recognition** (OCR): used for CogVLM 1 & 2 [[2]](#2), PaliGemma [[3]](#3), LLaVA-NeXT [[1]](#1), Phi-3-vision [[4]](#4), LLama 3.2 [[5]](#5).\\n\\n* VQA i.e. **visual question answering** (answer questions regarding the provided image): used for BLIP-2 [[9]](#9), LLaMA-Adapter [[10]](#10), PaliGemma [[3]](#3).\\n\\n* Various **visual grounding** tasks, in which the model learns to understand or generate references to positions inside an image, such as \u201cgrounded captioning\u201d, \u201creferring expression generation\u201d, \u201creferring expression comprehension\u201d, \u201cgrounded VQA\u201d... : used for CogVLM 1 & 2 [[2]](#2), PaliGemma [[3]](#3), LLama 3.2 [[5]](#5).\\n\\n* Reverse-engineering, to generate image source in **HTML, Markdown or Latex** : used for LLama 3.2 [[5]](#5).\\n\\n* Next text token prediction on **interleaved content** (text interleaved with one or several images, e.g. simplified web pages): used for Flamingo [[8]](#8), Phi-3-vision [[4]](#4). When several images are allowed, this can include training for **in-context learning**, which means that in training data, the text input (prompt or instruction) can include one or several examples of image paired with the expected answer, before inserting the image on which the model must answer.\\n\\n* **Multi-turn conversations** (chat) with image input, including **instruction following**, **image understanding**, multi-turn VQA, OCR, reasoning...: used for LLaVA & LLaVA-NeXT [[1]](#1), CogVLM 1 & 2 [[2]](#2), Phi-3-vision [[4]](#4), LLama 3.2 [[5]](#5).\\n\\n* **\\"Safety\\" training**, i.e. train to generate best answer among multiple candidate answers, as selected by human labellers: used for Phi-3-vision [[4]](#4).\\n\\nMoreover, additional fine-tuning steps based on **reinforcement learning with human feedback** (RLHF) can be added to increase (human) user satisfaction, for instance on VQA and chat with vision: this is applied for Phi-3-vision [[4]](#4) and LLama 3.2 [[5]](#5).\\n\\nAvailable bimodal (paired text and image) training data is probably not as big and diverse as unimodal data (text only or image only), which may induce risks of **overfitting** during these bimodal training steps. Unfortunately, most papers studied here are not verbose on solutions against overfitting. Dropouts, weight decays seem commonly used and tuned; yet, Llava 1.5 [[1]](#1) avoids weight decay. Image augmentation is studied but not generalized: for instance, BLIP-2 [[9]](#9) benefits from random resized cropping and horizontal flipping, and Flamingo [[8]](#8) adds color augmentation; but PaliGemma [[3]](#3) just relies on label smoothing and dropout, without any data augmentation, which is proven to have no significant benefit. Llama-3.2 [[5]](#5) goes further with a model soup: a \\"hyperparameter sweep\\" is run with multiple random data subsets and hyperparameter combinations, then the models are ranked, and finally, the weights of best models are averaged to obtain the final model.\\n\\n\\n## Freeze or don\'t freeze?\\n\\nWe have understood that the most impressive VLMs, such as LLama 3.2 [[5]](#5), have followed a quite long chain of training steps, with different task(s) at each step. We know that bimodal (vision-language) training steps follow the unimodal (language-only and vision-only) ones, that had previously been implemented to train the blind language model and the image encoder. But a question remains: how the ensure that during vision-language training, the VLM does not (catastrophically) forget what its two components (image encoder, language model) had correctly learnt?\\n\\nThe answer is in the **freezing strategy** chosen for each model. Freezing the weights of both the image encoder and the language model, while training only the adapter and new layers added when building the VLM, is a secure way to avoid catastrophic forgetting, and to reduce risks of overfitting on images: it was adopted in earlier papers (Flamingo [[8]](#8), LLaMA-Adapter [[10]](#10), MiniGPT-4 [[11]](#11)). However, total freezing probably reduces the ability of the VLM to maximize its performance on new vision-language tasks. Therefore, more recent works have experimented, with success, various unfreezing strategies. An intermediate strategy is to freeze the 2 initial models during the first vision-language training steps, and to unfreeze them (or one of the two) in the last training steps, as explained for BLIP-2 [[9]](#9), LLaVA & LLaVA-NeXT [[1]](#1), CogVLM 1 & 2 [[2]](#2). Some research teams go further: in LLama 3.2 [[5]](#5), the image encoder is not frozen at all, whilst the language model is unfrozen after a few vision-language training steps. More impressively, PaliGemma [[3]](#3) is trained without any freezing.\\n\\nAdditionally, to preserve performance on text-only tasks, some papers explain that some vision-language training steps include language-only data, for instance CogVLM 2 [[2]](#2) and Phi-3-vision [[4]](#4).\\n\\nHere is a simplified summary of the freezing strategies:\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Blind_Language_Model/freezing_strategy.png)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nVision language models, and more generally multimodal generative AI, are a very active field of research: we have lifted the hood of some foundational or recent scientific papers, with no claim to exhaustiveness. To sum up what we have observed in this article, we may remember that:\\n\\n* An already trained language model can be \u201cconverted\u201d to a vision language model (VLM) thanks to image encoder plugging and dedicated additional training steps, without significant decrease of its language abilities. Thus most VLMs defined in state-of-the-art papers are based on a previously trained blind (unimodal) language model, and rely on this \u201cconversion\u201d process. \\n\\n* Plugging the image encoder may rely on cross-attention, or on self-attention with an adapter; there is currently no clear winner between these two alternative options.\\n\\n* Simple deep learning layers can be applied to compensate initial misalignment between image representation and text representation.\\n\\n* Rich and various training tasks (and of course, training data) are essential to get a performant VLM, and are presumably more important than architecture details.\\n\\n* Most advanced recipes to build and train a VLM rely on progressive vision-language training (up to six steps) with progressive unfreezing of the language model.\\n\\n\\n## References\\n\\n#### [1]\\n\\n[Visual instruction tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08485) (H.

Library created by Ekimetrics.\\n- Azure Databricks \u2013 Hosts the Python functionality that processes the documents, generates vector embeddings (numerical representations of text for better searching), and stores them for efficient retrieval. It also sends requests to GPT-4.o API to answer the pre-defined questions.\\n- Azure Container Registry \u2013 Stores Docker images for the front end.\\n- Docker - A containerization platform that packages applications and their dependencies into isolated environments called containers, making it easier to deploy and run applications, as it ensures consistency of dependencies across different environments.\\n- Azure Search Service \u2013 Acts as the \\"brain\\" for finding relevant documents. When a user asks a question, it looks for the most relevant information in the stored data.\\n- Azure Key Vault \u2013 Stores and protects sensitive information such as API keys and passwords.\\n- Azure OpenAI\u2013 Service that provides access to an GPT-4.o API -  the LLM that takes the retrieved documents and generates a well-formed response.\\n- Bitbucket \u2013 A Git-based platform for source code management and version control. Bitbucket hosts the project repositories, tracks changes, and integrates with the CI/CD pipeline to automatically trigger builds, tests, and deployment processes when updates are made to the dev or main branches. We have two repositories, one for the UI, and the other for the backend of the Document Upload Dashboard.\\n- Poetry \u2013 A Python dependency management tool that helps package and manage libraries, ensuring consistent dependencies across different environments.\\n- Python \u2013 A high-level programming language widely used for data science, machine learning, web development, and automation, and known for its readability and extensive ecosystem of libraries. This is the only language we use to create the tool.\\n\\nThe Global Assessment Dashboard is powered by:\\n- Storage Account \u2013 Where all the generated reports with the company scores are stored. \\n- Power BI \u2013 A business analytics tool by Microsoft that enables the creation of interactive visualizations and reports.\\n\\n### The RAG architecture \\n\\nRAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is an AI framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to answer user queries more precisely. It works in three steps:\\n- Retrieval \u2013 Searches a knowledge base (e.g., databases, documents, or APIs) for relevant context, based on the user query.\\n- Augmentation \u2013 Injects the retrieved data into the prompt to an LLM, to provide additional context.\\n- Generation \u2013 Uses an LLM to generate a response, grounding answers in factual data.\\n\\nAs such, RAGs reduce hallucinations by ensuring that responses are based on actual data rather than only the model\u2019s pre-trained knowledge, and enhances explainability by providing references to the text used for generating the response. This architecture also leverages the state of the art LLMs, and avoids having to go through the expensive and complex process of training a specialised LLM.\\n\\nExample use cases of RAG implementations include Ekimetrics\u2019 Climate Q&A [^2], and CLAIRE [^3]. Climate Q&A simplifies access to environmental science by answering questions based on extensive scientific reports, including those from the IPCC and IPBES. CLAIRE is a multi-agent generative AI system that helps to democratize topics of Responsible AI. Both are part of the \u201cdigital communs\u201d that Ekimetrics provides for free to the community.\\n\\nFigure 6 shows the RAG architecture of the ESG Due Diligence tool. The flow begins with a set of predefined due diligence questions, stored as a file in Azure Blob storage, which are also retrievable on the UI to allow users to see the questions when they select the dedicated option. Next, we have users uploading company documents, which are stored in Azure Blob Storage, and are also made retrievable to allow the user to download them on demand (useful, for example, when a user might like to generate an updated company score that uses a recently published financial statement, and they want to see whether that document has already been used). The architecture of data and file storage follows Ekimetrics data engineering standards, with data layers. Next, parsing, chunking, summarising of chunks, embedding and indexing are deployed and raun in Databricks, as a Workflow that calls these functionalities (illustrated in Figure 7). Summaries of chunks are indexed by including meta data such as the company name, document type, document year, page number, etc, ensuring that the retrieval is company-specific, and in the future will facilitate other functionality such as year-specific report generation. With the Indexed Data available, we are ready to do two things: \\n\\n1.\\tGenerate the report for the company. That is, creating an Excel file with the answers to all the due diligence questions, based on the available company documents. The report also contains all the summarised chunks used to provide answers. This helps the user to check for themselves the references.  This is done as part of the first Databricks Workflow (figure 7).\\n2.\\tTo answer user queries prompted through the UI chatbot.\\n\\nThe report generated for each company is stored in Azure Blob Storage. The report is then used in three following steps:\\n1.\\tIt is made available for on-demand retrieval, so users can download the document\\n2.\\tIt is used for showing the company scores on the UI\\n3.\\tIt is used for updating the scores on the Global Assessment Dashboard (see dedicated section below)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/ESG_Diligence/ESG_Figure_6A.svg)\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/ESG_Diligence/ESG_Figure_6B.svg)\\n\\n*Figure 6 - RAG architecture( Data Preparation Workflow and Question Answering Workflow)*\\n\\n\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/ESG_Diligence/ESG_Figure_7.png)\\n\\n*Figure 7 - Databricks Workflow*\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\n### GenAI and RAG Architecture Optimisations\\n\\nWe have made several optimisations to the baseline Ekimetrics RAG architecture. These are described below.\\n\\n#### Reformulation prompt\\n\\nWe use a reformulation prompt which converts user input, and historical exchanges within the same session into a well-structured, standalone question. Our reformulation prompt begins by presenting a summary of the previous conversation to provide context. Then, it instructs the model to rewrite the user\u2019s message as a concise, self-contained query in natural language (in this case, English). This structure ensures that the reformulated question is clear and contextually relevant. Reformulation improves document retrieval accuracy. The uplift of this approach still needs to be tested and quantified for our particular use case.\\n\\n#### Embedding of summary of chunks\\n\\nWe embed summaries of chunks, instead of the raw chunks themselves, as this provides several advantages: \\n1.\\tSummaries are shorter, resulting in smaller embeddings, which means that vector searches are faster and storage costs are lower.\\n2.\\tRaw text chunks often contain redundant or irrelevant details, but a summary distils the key information and encodes high-level meaning, making embeddings more focused, and leading to better semantic retrieval.\\n3.\\tFeeding summaries, rather than raw chunks, to the context window for the LLM can lead to better generation.\\n4.\\tIt may lead to reduced hallucinations, as LLMs may generate hallucinations when retrieving overly large or unstructured chunks.\\n\\nSuch a strategy is not applicable to a RAG in every context. For example, when using a RAG to cite legal text, it would be necessary to have specific details; summarisation would not be appropriate.\\n\\nThe uplift of this approach still needs to be tested and quantified for our particular use case.\\n\\n#### Choice of model\\nWe are using LLMs at four stages of the RAG process:\\n1.\\tReformulation\\n2.\\tChunk summarisation\\n3.\\tGeneration\\n4.\\tTesting framework\\n\\nWe have used ChatGPT 4.o for all the stages due to lower costs and performance..  We plan on testing different models for different purposes, including using a superior model in a testing framework to judge the performance of ChatGPT 4.o in answering the questions.\\n\\n#### Chatbot prompts\\n\\nWe have a structured prompting strategy for the LLM that answers, both, the due diligence questions and the chatbot user queries, that provides several advantages for the RAG. We force fact-based responses that are grounded on the documents provided. This ensures that responses are more accurate, and hallucinations are reduced. We provide the tool clear guidelines on how to handle ambiguity, for example, if a company does not meet a criterion or if it does not find relevant information, the model will state \\"No\\" as an answer to the question,  preventing the model from making up answers. We force the tool to provide structured answers, for example, clear \u2018yes\u2019/ \u2018no\u2019 responses, which, in turn, help the later stages in the pipeline to automate the scores calculations. \\n\\nWe instruct the tool to provide references, to ensure traceability and verifiability of facts. This is important, not only to provide confidence to the users to trust the output, but also, in fields such as finance, ESG reporting, or compliance, clear referencing and fact-based responses help meet regulatory requirements. \\n\\n#### Parameter value\\n\\nTo improve the quality of the answers generated by the tool, several key parameters were optimized based on Faithfulness, Contextual Relevancy, and Answer Relevancy performance scores. These metrics are explained in detail in [GenAI Testing Framework section] of the article. We focus on specific parameters that impact how the system processes, retrieves, and generates responses. \\n\\n- Optimising **Chunking parameters**: Chunking directly influences text segmentation and  encoding; it determines how the input text is divided into segments, affecting how much context is retained per segment, before each chunk is summarised, indexed and stored. The specific metrics optimised were the maximum chunk size (max_tokens), and the chunk_overlap, which is a parameter that ensures continuity between chunks, so that details are not lost. \\n- Optimising **Retrieval parameters**: Retrieval parameters control how the tool selects relevant (summarised) chunks of text from the (indexed) database before generating answers. The parameter optimised is the number of relevant chunks retrieved for answering a question (top_k). \\n- Optimising **Generation parameters**: The Generation Parameters controls the LLM output tuning, that is, how the model formulates responses, balancing creativity and precision. The parameters that have been tuned are the temperature, which makes the responses more deterministic and grounded on the resources available at lower values (close to 0), or more creative, at values closer to 1. The top_p parameter controls response diversity by selecting the most probable rather than random variations or words. \\n\\nWhen tuning the parameters for chunking, retrieval, and generation, different trade-offs emerge. The challenge is to find a balance that maximizes faithfulness, contextual relevancy, and answer relevancy without compromising efficiency or cost. For example, optimising chunk size is a trade-off between completeness vs. overload, where larger chunks (i.e. higher values for max_token and chunk_overlap) would improve between faithfulness (because we would have more context within a single pass) and improved contextual relevancy  (because it would reduce fragmentation), but it would incur higher computation costs, and have a risk of losing critical context and introducing irrelevant information as the chunks may contain unrelated data. Similarly, optimising retrieval depth is an exercise in striking the right balance between relevance and noise; retrieving more chunks (higher top_k), would provide more information and increase the chances of retrieving the right context, therefore improving answer relevancy; however, this would come at a cost of introducing contextual irrelevancy and slower performance due to having to process more data. Generation parameters define the balance between precision and diversity; lower temperature would ground answers on retrieved information, but would make the answers too rigid. Lower top_p would prioritise high-confidence responses, but may ignore less common but relevant insights.\\n\\nTable 3A shows the optimised parameter values, and Tables 3B and 3C show performance metrics based on these parameter values. Noting that the scores on table 3B are the arithmetic averages of the scores across all the general (36) and industry specific (5) questions for one company. The total_score on table 3C is the average mean between the faithfulness_score and the answer_relevancy score. This global metric was chosen as it is a simple and intuitive way to summarize the performance of the whole tool and  provides a balanced assessment of both accuracy and direct usefulness.\\n\\nWhen evaluating retrieval performance, in our case, it\'s important not to overemphasize **contextual relevancy**, as this metric assesses the proportion of retrieved sources that are pertinent to the query. If only some references are relevant, the score may appear low, even when the relevant information has been correctly extracted. In our case, we aim to determine whether all pertinent information has been extracted, even if, for example, only one out of ten documents is relevant. Ideally, if the language model utilizes that single relevant document appropriately, the contextual relevancy should be 100%. However, DeepEval\'s contextual relevancy metric evaluates the overall relevance of all extracted documents to the question, as an example, resulting in a score of 10% when only one out of ten documents is relevant. Creating a custom metric within DeepEval would better align with our evaluation objectives, and we plan to look into this in the future.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/ESG_Diligence/ESG_Table_3A.png)\\n\\n*Table 3A \u2013 Optimised parameters values*\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/ESG_Diligence/ESG_Table_3B.png)\\n\\n*Table 3B \u2013 Optimised performance metrics*\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/ESG_Diligence/ESG_Table_3C.png)\\n\\n*Table 3C \u2013 Total performance score of the tool*\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nAs mentioned above, the optimisation of the metrics has so far been implemented based on one company, and using a grid search of a specific set of values for each parameter value, recommended by members of Ekimetrics\u2019 GenAI Taskforce. More work will need to be done to optimise other parameter values, such as the temperature, as well as to take into account the answers across all industry sectors, and to evaluate the performance based on other considerations, such as number of documents available for example.\\n\\n### GenAI Testing framework\\n\\nWe have established an evaluation pipeline for assessing responses generated by the tool, using the DeepEval framework [^4]. We focus on three evaluation metrics: Faithfulness, Answer Relevancy and Context Relevancy. These three metrics have been prioritised for practical purposes, as they provide a comprehensive testing of the performance of both the retriever and the generator (Table 4), and, essentially, together they provide a measure of \u201creliability\u201d of the answer.\\n\\nContextual Relevancy tests the relevance of the retrieved text to the user input. Mathematically it is calculated as shown below, hence taking values between 0 and 1. Higher values indicate that the retriever selects chunks that are relevant to the user query (and previous conversations due to the reformulation prompt \u2013 see the relevant section under \u201cGenAI and RAG Architecture Optimisations\u201d).\\n\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/ESG_Diligence/ESG_Formula_1.png)\\n\\nFaithfulness assesses whether the response accurately reflects the provided source material. Mathematically it is calculated as shown below, therefore ranging between 0 and 1. Higher values indicate more factual responses.\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/ESG_Diligence/ESG_Formula_2.png)\\n\\nAnswer Relevancy checks if the response appropriately answers the question.  Mathematically it is calculated as shown below, therefore ranging between 0 and 1. Higher values indicate more on point responses.\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/ESG_Diligence/ESG_Formula_3.png)\\n\\nOther metrics we considered implementing were Hallucination, Summarisation, and Faithfulness against the testing dataset (see table 3).\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/ESG_Diligence/ESG_Table_4.png)\\n\\n*Table 4 - RAG performance metrics; in blue are those implemented in our solution.*\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nThe testing framework essentially consists of a function that iterates over the Pandas DataFrame containing the questions, answers and references that will be used to generate the company report; it scores the responses with the performance metrics, storing the result for each question-answer pair. Then, the arithmetic averages of each metric across all answers, as well as the arithmetic mean of the Faithfulness and Answer Relevancy metrics is also calculated \u2013 named the total score. Tables 3B and 3C show the values of these global metrics with the optimised parameter values in table 3A. Section GenAI and RAG Architecture Optimisations explains how the parameters were optimised.\\n\\nThe testing framework is integrated into the report-generating Databricks workflow (Figure 7). To evaluate parameters, we set a chosen parameter value and run the workflow for a company that has already been parsed and embedded. The output is an Excel file containing answers to each question, their respective scores on the three selected metrics, and a summary tab with overall scores and the parameter values used in that test run. This structure allows for easy comparison of parameters, scores, and responses across different test runs. \\n\\n### Packaged Solution with CI/CD\\n\\nTo enhance the scalability of our solution, we have transitioned from a manual deployment process to an automated, package-based approach. This shift improves maintainability, reduces human error, and streamlines the integration of new features, thus ensuring the stability and longevity of the tool.\\n\\n\\n#### POC version of the tool\\n\\nThe POC production pipeline ran directly on Databricks. This setup presented several risks: dependencies were partially listed in workflow tasks and partially installed dynamically during execution, so the process required manual management of dependencies. The POC also had environment file vulnerabilities as .env files were not versioned, making scripts sensitive to unintended modifications. There was no automated testing - updates would require manual testing. Version control was also not well established, creating versioning risks with later teams of developers.\\n\\n#### The Packaged Solution with CI/CD\\n\\nTo address these challenges, we implemented a CI/CD pipeline in Bitbucket, which automates packaging and deployment to Databricks. The full pipeline is illustrated in Figure 8. The key improvements include a package-based deployment to Databricks, automated dependency management using Poetry and automatically made available to job clusters, bundled in the CI/CD pipeline, .env files were phased out in favour of environment variables managed in Bitbucket and Azure Keyvault (for secrets), and automated testing with a dedicated test stage in the Bitbucket pipeline which runs unit tests (and in the future integration tests) before allowing merges into dev or main (i.e. if tests fail, the merge is blocked).\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/ESG_Diligence/ESG_Figure_8.svg)\\n\\n*Figure 8 \u2013 Product packaging and CI/CD pipeline*\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nNow, updates to the code base will work as follows:\\n1.\\tDevelopers create a feature branch in Bitbucket\u2019s dev workspace and start an interactive cluster where all dependencies are pre-installed.\\n2.\\tCode changes are implemented, and if new dependencies are required, they are added to the Poetry configuration.\\n3.\\tA merge request is submitted to the dev branch, triggering the CI/CD pipeline.\\n4.\\tThe CI/CD pipeline automatically: \\n    - Runs tests to validate the changes. \\n    - Packages the project and dependencies.\\no\\tUpdates the workflow tasks on Databricks dev.\\n5.\\tTesting is streamlined: once the pipeline finishes, the new version is ready to test.\\n6.\\tDeployment to production: when merging dev into main, the same CI/CD pipeline executes, ensuring a smooth, error-free rollout.\\n\\nThe uplift in efficiency of the tool translates to accelerated feature development and release cycles, as well as freeing up valuable development time to focus on innovation rather than maintenance.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/ESG_Diligence/ESG_Table_9.svg)\\n\\n*Table 9 \u2013 Development workflow in packaged version of the solution.*\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\n### Responsible AI\\n\\nEkimetrics\u2019 Responsible AI Framework [5] ensures that AI models are developed and deployed with comprehensive awareness of their impact. The framework consists of seven key pillars: transparency, explicability, interpretability, security, robustness, vigilance, and sustainability. By applying these principles, Ekimetrics ensures we implement solutions that use AI responsibly, preventing misuse and ensuring they are ethical, reliable, and sustainable.\\n\\nOur tool abides by these pillars in the following ways:\\n\\nTransparency: This pilar refers to adopting ways to clearly communicate the actual way the tools is implemented, how the data is collected, and how it is envisioned to be used. Concretely, Ekimetrics suggests several approaches, including creating a model card  and releasing open source code and scientific papers. We start our journey with this pillar through the publication of this paper, with work on a model card under way.\\n\\nExplicability: To adopt the explicability pillar we provide users with all the references, or retrieved data, that was used to generate each answer, both for the report and the chatbot functionality. Future implementation will include user feedback features.\\n\\nRobustness: Robustness is about measuring and ensuring the performance of the system and its stability all along its life cycle, together with monitoring and retraining when necessary, as well as the ability to manage adversarial attacks. We have implemented a robust testing framework with through-out relevant performance metrics. The tool is designed to keep track of the performance of reports generated year-on-year.\\n\\nSustainability: is concerned with the environmental costs of running the solution. We have used Ekimetrics\u2019 existing tool, the Carbon Tracking Dashboard, which helps us monitor the carbon footprint and costs of IT solutions ran on Azure resources. This tool enables optimised use of Databricks clusters, both for cost and carbon footprint management.\\n\\nSecurity: The core concept of this pillar is to ensure the protection of personal and sensitive data. As no personal data is used in the tool, this is not a concern.\\n\\nVigilance: The purpose of this pilar is to avoid any possible harm to the users\u2019 interests, especially to exclude discriminatory biases. One immediately applicable concern could be that the tool could provide more favourable scores to companies that have more, rather than less documentation provided to the tool. It would be important to also ensure that we study the correlation of the score against other company criteria, such as gender and ethnicity distribution of the company\u2019s leadership, geography, company size, etc, to ensure there is no inherent bias. As of yet, we have not observed such bias, but a detailed study is outstanding.\\n\\n### Backend of the Global Assessment Tool\\n\\nThis is a sub-flow from that shown in Figure 6. Given all the company reports, the Data bricks Workflow in figure 7 finishes the last step and stores the report in Azure blog storage, which then feeds the Global Assessment Dashboard. The data is refreshed automatically on the web app.\\n\\n## Implementation timeline and team expertise\\n\\nIt took 80 FTE days to build this solution to the standard described above. This time represents a significant internal investment, mainly from Ekimetrics UK and Ekimetrics France, contributing to the global sustainability effort. The tool was built on existing Ekimetrics resources, such as the Eki-parser and a proprietary templated RAG architecture, which was optimised by the developer team for this particular use case. The team consisted of specialists in sustainability, infrastructure as code, data engineering and GenAI methodologies, as well as general data science consultants and developers.\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\nWe are committed to continuously improving the tool to enhance its usability, accuracy, and impact (table 5).\\n\\nOn the user adoption front, we will track user uptake metrics and integrate with our CRM to ensure the tool remains aligned with our customer base. Additionally, we plan to develop an automated gap analysis and recommendation engine to guide our teams, alongside year-on-year sustainability maturity assessments and benchmarking capabilities.\\n\\nTo refine model performance, we will assess the use of a reranker step, enhance the GenAI testing framework with automated monitoring, and improve prompting to ensure better alignment with sustainability topics. For tool performance, we will implement logging and monitoring, add background information on CSR regulations, and integrate insights on Ekimetrics\u2019 offerings. From a data perspective, we will establish a structured database to support analysis and reporting, ensuring transparency and accountability through model cards. We will assess the GenAI performance metrics based on industry sectors, company size, geography, number of documents and other factors, to ensure we assess any bias.\\n\\nWe are also committed to making our Generative AI usage more sustainable by optimizing energy consumption and reducing unnecessary model usage. To achieve this, we will track environmental performance through the Green IT Dashboard, monitoring carbon footprint and energy consumption at each stage of the RAG process. Specifically, we will evaluate trade-offs between model size, accuracy, and sustainability, experiment with smaller models where possible. \\n\\nFinally, as we expand go-to-market features, we will incorporate additional sustainability frameworks to enhance the tool\u2019s versatility and relevance.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/ESG_Diligence/ESG_Table_5.png)\\n\\n*Table 5.

This paper introduces the Client ESG Due Diligence Tool, an automated solution that evaluates sustainability risks and opportunities of working with clients, whatever the industry they operate in. Questioning how we do our business is an essential part of our \u201cMission\u201d. Built on our rigorous GenAI, Data Engineering, Responsible AI and MLOps standards, it is a packaged product that showcases our expertise in creating and implementing GenAI solutions for businesses, which enhance efficiency by streamlining workflows and standardizing processes. We share our approach, tech stack, and implementation insights, showcasing how this kind of automation can drive impactful ESG business decisions.\\n\\n## Introduction \\nEkimetrics\' Sustainability Report[^1] showcases our company\u2019s commitment to embedding sustainability into its operations, processes, and services. Assessing the sustainability practices of clients and prospects enables us to ensure that our services contribute to positive impact, rather than enabling unsustainable business models. The tool described in this article, the Client ESG Due Diligence Tool, plays a crucial role in this endeavour.  The tool automates client company evaluation, providing structured insights that help identify risks, as well as areas where Ekimetrics can support clients in improving their own sustainability efforts. It is a similar concept to the classic \u201csupplier due diligence\u201d ESG-check, except that here, we question our downward value chain for its sustainability alignment, rather than the upward value chain.\\n\\nThe tool is, in essence, a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an AI framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to answer user queries more precisely, and in specialised domains. This kind of architecture ensures that responses are based on factual data, rather than only the model\u2019s pre-trained knowledge, and enhances explainability by providing references to the text used for generating responses. Such optimisation avoids having to go through the expensive and complex process of training a dedicated LLMs for a specific topic.\\n\\nThe tool is built upon Ekimetrics\u2019 rigorous standards in GenAI, Data Engineering, MLOps and Responsible AI, ensuring reliability, scalability and trustworthiness. This work is reflective of our expertise in developing robust GenAI software solutions that drive business operational efficiency, by streamlining workflows, freeing up valuable time from maintenance, for innovation, as well as providing standardisation to processes. We believe this specific solution \u2013 an automated due diligence based on documentation \u2013 is, indeed, applicable, and valuable, to other business settings, so in this paper we share, in detail, our approach, showcasing the tech stack and technical implementation of the solution.\\n\\n## How the Tool is Used\\n\\nESG due diligence allows partners, managers, and commercial teams at Ekimetrics to determine how well a client company aligns with our own sustainability goals.  \\nEkimetrics\u2019 ESG due diligence process involves analysing company reports that are, publicly available online, such as financial reports, sustainability reports, supplier code of conduct, charter and certifications, and other company documentation, and extracting relevant information in order to answer predefined ESG-specific questions. If done manually, this process can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, risking inconsistent assessments and delayed decision-making.\\n\\nThe Client ESG Due Diligence tool is designed to address these pain points, in a way that is intuitive and user friendly. It consists of a dashboard \u2013 the Document Upload Dashboard \u2013 where users can upload company documents, which are then used to automatically carry out the due diligence and to calculate company risk scores (Figure 1). The dashboard also facilitates the search for scores of existing and already-screened companies and the download of the full company diligence report (Figure 2). Finally, a specialised chatbot, available directly on the same dashboard, assists users in developing a deeper understanding of the screened companies, and helps them identify new opportunities where Ekimetrics could support clients on their own sustainability practices (Figure 3).  The tool also allows the user to check existing company documents in the database, as well as past due diligence reports, which helps them assess the date and reliability of the scores. The more documents provided for a client company, the more accurate their ESG risk score. \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/ESG_Diligence/ESG_Figure_1.png)\\n\\n*Figure 1 \u2013 Users can upload company documents on the Document Upload Dashboard*\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\n### The Due Diligence Questionnaire\\n\\nThe due diligence questionnaire consists of a mixture of questions that, either apply to all companies, or that are industry specific. The questions are labelled by the categories shown in Table 1, and include questions such as \u201cDoes {the company} have a sustainability policy to promote diversity and inclusion?\u201d (as an example of the general question) or \u201cDoes {company} have a strategy with clear targets and timelines to switch to renewable energy sources?\u201d (as an example of an industry-specific question for the Transportation/Mobility sector). Each question is answered by the tool automatically, basing the response only on the company documents provided by the user.\\n\\nThe questions have been developed by Ekimetrics\u2019 ESG team, with the support of an external consultant to ensure the relevance and alignment on international frameworks. The tool allows for the questions to evolve over time. \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/ESG_Diligence/ESG_Table_1.png)\\n\\n*Table 1 \u2013 Topics and categories of Ekimetrics\u2019 client ESG due diligence*\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\n### The Company Report\\n\\nEach company\'s report is generated as an Excel file containing automatically produced responses to both general and industry-specific questions. For each answer, the report includes the supporting references, detailing the extracted text along with the document name and page number. This structure allows users to delve into the specifics and assess the reliability of each response as needed. Scores are then calculated based on the number of affirmative answers, as outlined in the following section.\\n\\n### The Scoring System \\n\\nFigure 2 shows that for each client there are multiple scores. In fact, we derive thirteen elementary scores:\\n- one for each of the categories listed in Table 1\\n- one for the general questions\\n- one for the industry questions\\n- one total score \u2013 i.e. for all the questions\\n\\nand one composite score, made up of the policy, reporting and certifications scores. The elementary scores are calculated as the proportion of questions that have \u201cyes\u201d as an answer, out of all the questions. The composite score is the sum of the policy, reporting and or certification scores, depending on the industry sector (see Table 2).\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/ESG_Diligence/ESG_Figure_2.png)\\n\\n*Figure 2 \u2013 Check the scores for a company*\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nOnce a score is calculated, deciding how to engage with the client is an automated process, based on a decision tree (Figure 3). The decision tree is not only dependent on the score, but also the industry sector. First, industry sectors are categorised into four groups of risk: critical risk, high risk, medium risk, and no risk. By default, we willingly engage in business with companies that fall in the no risk industry sectors category, which include green technologies and renewable energy. As a matter of policy, Ekimetrics does not engage in work with companies in critical risk industry sectors. For the high and medium risk categories, Ekimetrics\u2019 engagement is determined by their commercial and sustainability goals, strategies, and commitments. \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/ESG_Diligence/ESG_Table_2.png)\\n\\n*Table 2 \u2013 Procedure for calculating the composite risk score depending on the industry sector.*\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/ESG_Diligence/ESG_Figure_3.svg)\\n\\n*Figure 3 \u2013 Decision tree on how to engage with clients \u2013 the actual threshold of acceptance for each industry sectors within a particular risk category also has a range and depends on the specific sector.*\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\n### The Chatbot\\n\\nFigure 4 shows the chatbot tab on the User Interface (UI). The user selects the company they want to explore, and asks a question on the dedicated window. The tool answers all questions based only on the available company documents as well as the history of their conversation. Further, following our company\u2019s standards for Responsible AI [5], specifically the Explainability pillar, all parts of the answer are referenced to specific text in the resources section of the page.\\n\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/ESG_Diligence/ESG_Figure_4.png)\\n\\n*Figure 4 \u2013 Specialised chatbot that helps the user to understand the company more deeply.*\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\n### The Global Assessment Dashboard\\n\\nThis resource displays summarised visualisations of all the scores for all the client companies in the database (Figure 5), allowing top management, commercial and sustainability leads to understand the overall ESG performance of our client-base at a glance. This can help them identify high-risk companies, and assist them to prioritize industry sectors for sustainability improvements and strategic engagement. As the tool is built on PowerBI, it enables easy manipulation and filtering of the data, allowing the user to focus on specific sectors, companies, or groups of companies that fall within a specific range of a score, or are a particular risk category.  \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/ESG_Diligence/ESG_Figure_5.png)\\n\\n*Figure 5 - The Global Assessment Dashboard*\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\n### User feedback\\n\\nFrom Renaud Pirel (Partner at Ekimetrics):\\n- We all carry unconscious biases when assessing the \\"ESG compliance\\" of a particular industry or business.

This paper presents a systematic framework for selecting between AI Models, AI Workflows, and AI Agents based on empirical evidence from production implementations across multiple industries. Our analysis demonstrates that architectural decisions should be driven by operational constraints and business requirements rather than technological novelty. We provide quantitative comparisons and decision criteria derived from real-world deployments in FinTech, Gaming, and Non-profit sectors.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Architectural Taxonomy\\n\\nFollowing the widespread adoption of generative AI, two primary design patterns have emerged beyond direct model integration: AI Workflows, which employ orchestrated, deterministic processes, and AI Agents, which utilize autonomous, LLM-driven decision-making. These architectures represent distinct approaches to balancing development velocity, operational control, and system adaptability.\\n\\n### Architectural Definitions\\n\\n**AI Models**: Direct integration of large language models without additional orchestration layers. Implementation involves prompt engineering and API integration for language generation tasks.\\n- Advantages: Minimal development overhead, cost-effective deployment\\n- Limitations: Constrained transparency, absence of external system integration\\n\\n**AI Workflows**: Structured, deterministic sequences that orchestrate LLMs with complementary tools, APIs, and data sources through predefined logic.\\n- Advantages: High operational control, comprehensive auditability, regulatory compliance\\n- Limitations: Architectural rigidity, substantial upfront design requirements\\n\\n**AI Agents**: Systems employing LLM-driven reasoning for autonomous decision-making, dynamic tool selection, and adaptive behavior based on contextual analysis.\\n- Advantages: Flexible adaptation, complex task handling, conversational interaction patterns\\n- Limitations: Development complexity, elevated operational costs, reduced predictability\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Empirical Case Studies\\n\\n### Implementation 1: Automated Climate Risk Assessment (FinTech)\\n**Technical Challenge**: Systematic automation of climate risk assessments incorporating 200+ data points while maintaining regulatory compliance and audit requirements.\\n\\n**Architectural Evaluation**:\\n- AI Models: Rejected due to output inconsistency across execution cycles, incompatible with financial risk assessment standards\\n- AI Agents: Excluded based on development timeline constraints (3-month delivery) and regulatory stability requirements\\n\\n**Selected Architecture**: AI Workflow\\n**Implementation Details**: Deterministic processing pipeline with embedded LLM components for structured reasoning and analysis.\\n\\n**Quantitative Outcomes**:\\n- Data integration: 200+ risk indicators per assessment\\n- Industry coverage: 1,023 ISIC-classified industries\\n- Automation rate: 100% (zero manual intervention required)\\n- Compliance: Full audit trail and expert validation integration\\n\\n### Implementation 2: Natural Language Data Interface (Non-profit)\\n**Technical Challenge**: Democratization of complex sustainability datasets for non-technical users through conversational interaction paradigms.\\n\\n**Architectural Evaluation**:\\n- AI Models: Insufficient for contextual memory and iterative query refinement\\n- AI Workflows: Inadequate for open-ended exploratory data analysis patterns\\n\\n**Selected Architecture**: AI Agent\\n**Implementation Details**: Dynamic query generation with real-time visualization and iterative analytical refinement capabilities.\\n\\n**Quantitative Outcomes**:\\n- Query accuracy improvement: 40% over traditional SQL approaches\\n- Execution time reduction: 70% (average response time ~5 seconds)\\n- User accessibility: Enabled independent data exploration for non-technical stakeholders\\n- Scalability: Adaptive system growth alongside organizational data expansion\\n\\n### Implementation 3: Text-to-SQL Interface (Gaming)\\n**Technical Challenge**: Real-time data access for business users without SQL proficiency, integrated with existing communication infrastructure.\\n\\n**Architectural Rationale**: Predictable query patterns and accelerated delivery timeline favored architectural stability over adaptive capabilities.\\n\\n**Selected Architecture**: AI Workflow\\n**Implementation Details**: Structured text-to-SQL conversion with deterministic validation and comprehensive error handling mechanisms.\\n\\n**Quantitative Outcomes**:\\n- Efficiency improvement: 98% reduction in query resolution time (30 minutes to 30 seconds)\\n- SQL generation accuracy: 90% success rate\\n- System integration: Seamless messenger application compatibility\\n- Operational impact: Elimination of IT team dependency for routine data requests\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Comparative Technical Analysis\\n\\n| Evaluation Criteria | AI Models | AI Workflows | AI Agents |\\n|---------------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|\\n| **Development Timeline** | Days to Weeks | Weeks to Months | Months |\\n| **Technical Complexity** | Low | Moderate | High |\\n| **Operational Costs** | Low | Medium | High |\\n| **Output Determinism** | Limited | High | Moderate |\\n| **System Explainability** | Variable | High | Medium |\\n| **Scalability Pattern** | Vertical | Manual Extension | Adaptive Evolution |\\n| **Integration Complexity** | Minimal | Moderate | Substantial |\\n| **Maintenance Overhead** | Low | Medium | High |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Implementation Guidelines\\n\\n### Architectural Selection Principles\\n\\n**Evidence-Based Decision Making**: Architectural choices should be driven by empirical requirements analysis rather than technological trends or novelty considerations.\\n\\n**Constraint-Driven Design**: System architecture must align with operational constraints including timeline, budget, regulatory requirements, and organizational technical capabilities.\\n\\n**Incremental Evolution Strategy**: Successful implementations often follow a progression from simple model integration through structured workflows to adaptive agent systems based on validated user requirements.\\n\\n### Common Implementation Patterns\\n\\n**Hybrid Architecture Approaches**: Production systems frequently combine elements from multiple architectural paradigms to optimize for specific functional requirements while maintaining overall system coherence.\\n\\n**Progressive Enhancement**: Organizations often begin with AI Model implementations for initial validation, evolve to AI Workflows for production stability, then selectively introduce AI Agent capabilities for complex interaction requirements.\\n\\n**Risk-Adjusted Implementation**: High-stakes applications typically favor deterministic workflow approaches, while exploratory or user-facing applications benefit from agent-based adaptive capabilities.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Architectural Evolution Trajectory\\n\\n```\\nAI Models \u2192 AI Workflows \u2192 AI Agents\\n    \u2191           \u2191            \u2191\\nValidation   Production    Adaptive\\nPhase        Stability     Evolution\\n```\\n\\nEmpirical evidence suggests that successful AI implementations often follow a maturation path from direct model integration through structured workflow orchestration to autonomous agent capabilities, with each phase addressing different organizational maturity and requirement complexity levels.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Technical Conclusions\\n\\n### Key Findings\\n\\n1. **Constraint-driven architecture selection** consistently outperforms technology-driven approaches in production environments\\n2. **Hybrid architectural strategies** frequently deliver superior outcomes compared to single-paradigm implementations  \\n3. **Operational control versus system adaptability** represents the fundamental architectural trade-off requiring explicit design consideration\\n4. **User interaction patterns** should drive architectural decisions rather than underlying technical capabilities\\n5. **Agent complexity overhead** requires substantial organizational investment in development, testing, and operational processes\\n\\n### Future Considerations\\n\\nAs large language model capabilities advance and

In our previous article, we established a conceptual framework distinguishing between the direct and indirect impact of communication, revealing the complexity of the mechanisms through which this sector influences our collective carbon footprint. Today, we transform this theoretical framework into a concrete measurement tool.  \\nIn a context where companies are called upon to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 5% per year, the communication industry faces a fundamental question: how to evaluate and optimize its real contribution to the ecological transition?\\n\\nThis question is all the more crucial as the recent [French ministerial report](https://www.linforme.com/energie/article/le-rapport-choc-qui-veut-rendre-la-publicite-plus-durable_2686.html) proposes a transformation of climate contracts and increased regulation of commercial communications. To respond in a quantified manner, we have conducted an in-depth analysis distinguishing between the direct footprint (linked to agency and media activities) and the indirect footprint (resulting from generated consumption behaviors).\\nOur study reveals an undeniable finding: while the direct footprint of the sector represents approximately 1.02 MtCO2e (or 0.27% of French national emissions), its indirect footprint reaches 16.55 MtCO2e, equivalent to 4.44% of the national carbon footprint. This ratio of 1 to 16 between direct and indirect impact persists even in our most conservative sensitivity analyses, where it varies from 4 to 80 depending on the assumptions. This disproportion upends the traditional perspective and demonstrates that beyond eco-designing campaigns, the sector\'s main lever for action lies in the strategic orientation of marketing investments.\\n\\n\\n## Direct Effect: Quantifying the Operational Footprint of Communication\\n\\nTo evaluate the direct carbon footprint of the sector, two methodological approaches are available:\\n\\n- The **top-down approach** relies on carbon assessments published by major players in the sector to estimate the overall impact of the industry. This method offers a macroscopic vision and allows capturing the diversity of communication professions.\\n- The **bottom-up approach** uses specific emission factors by type of activity to build an estimate from elementary processes. It allows a more granular analysis of emission sources.\\n\\nThe table below synthesizes the strengths and limitations of each method:\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Quantifying_Impact/Comparative_Table_1.png)\\n\\n*Table 1: Comparative study of methods for estimating the direct impact of communication.*\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nFor this first global assessment, we favored the top-down approach, while recognizing that it may lead to a high estimate of the sector\'s footprint.\\n\\n### Data from Major Communication Groups\\n\\nOur analysis is based on the CSR reports of the six largest global communication groups, whose carbon intensities (kgCO\u2082e/\u20ac) were calculated by relating their total emissions (scopes 1, 2, and 3) to their turnover:\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Quantifying_Impact/Comparative_Table_2.png)\\n\\n*Table 2: Comparison of emissions from communications companies according to their level of activity*\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\n\\\\* No clear location-based data were available for scope 2, therefore market-based emissions might have been used.  \\n\\\\** Average conversion factor was used for the year to turn the data in euro    \\n\\\\*** Scope 3 covers only aviation, so the data were ignored\\n\\nThis analysis reveals an interesting trend: French groups (Publicis, Havas) present a significantly lower carbon intensity than their international counterparts. This difference could be explained by earlier sensitivity to environmental issues in France or by specificities in the structure of activities. However, the variation remains contained within a factor of 1 to 4, suggesting a certain sectoral consistency.\\n\\nFor our national estimate, we retained the average value of **0.031 kgCO\u2082e/\u20ac**, which represents a prudent and robust approximation of the sector\'s carbon intensity.\\n\\n### Carbon Footprint of the Sector in France\\n\\nAccording to data from Arcom (Arcom, 2024), the business volume of communication in France amounts to 33 billion euros, divided between media (52%) and non-media (48%). By applying our average carbon intensity factor of 0.031 kgCO\u2082e/\u20ac to this activity volume, we obtain a direct footprint **of 1.02 MtCO\u2082e for the entire sector, or about 0.27% of French national emissions** (373 MtCO\u2082e in 2023 according to CITEPA, 2024).\\n\\nThis estimate, although significant, places the communication sector among moderate contributors to direct national emissions. However, as we will see in the next section, this vision captures only a fraction of the sector\'s real environmental impact.\\n\\n## Indirect Effect: Measuring the Impact of Communication on Consumption\\n\\nAfter quantifying the direct operational footprint of communication, we tackle a more complex challenge: evaluating its impact on consumption behaviors and, consequently, on the associated greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\n### Review of Scientific Literature\\n\\nOur approach is based on an in-depth analysis of academic studies and gray literature. We identified two main categories of relevant publications:\\n- ROI aggregation studies that estimate the economic effectiveness of communication at the advertiser level.\\n- Macroeconomic analyses that measure the effect of advertising on consumption volume and GDP growth.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Quantifying_Impact/Decomposition.png)\\n\\n*Figure 1: Decomposition of measured effects as a function of the observed variable.*\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nThe table below summarizes the main international studies on the subject:\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Quantifying_Impact/Table_analysis.png)\\n\\n*Table 3: Summary of analyses on the impact of communication*\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\n\\n## Methodology: Translating Economic Impact into Carbon Footprint\\n\\nTo establish a robust method, we distinguished three different approaches in these studies:\\n\\n1.\\t**ROI aggregation** without accounting for the adverse effect between competitors\\n2.\\t**Estimation of overall impact** on consumption (useful for modeling contribution to growth)\\n3.\\t**Calculation of marginal impact** allowing modeling of the effect of variations in investments\\n\\nWe favored the results of the \\"Value of Advertising\\" study (Deloitte, 2017) as a starting point, while adjusting them by a corrective factor integrating the more moderate results of other publications.\\n\\n### Structuring Hypotheses\\n\\nOur model is based on three fundamental hypotheses:\\n\\n1.\\t**Hypothesis of communication market efficiency**: We consider that media and non-media, each representing about 50% of investments, generate an equivalent median ROI.\\n2.\\t**Hypothesis of marginality of the price effect**: The price effect is considered secondary compared to the market growth effect. The work of Dubois, Griffith, and O\'Connell (Dubois, 2018, p. 421) on the British chip market shows that a total stop of advertising would generate only an increase in price sensitivity of less than 3%.\\n3.\\t**Hypothesis of GDP-Energy-Carbon correlation**: We rely on the work of Giraud (Giraud, 2014) demonstrating the strong historical correlation between GDP and energy consumption, allowing us to establish a carbon intensity factor per euro of GDP.\\n\\nFor methodological prudence, we did not integrate the adverse effect (redistribution between competitors) in our model, which leads to a minimal estimate of the potential impact of communication.\\n\\n### Calculation of the Indirect Footprint\\n\\nOur approach breaks down into three steps:\\n\\n**Step 1: Estimation of generated consumption**\\n\\nWe start with the GDP generation factor of \u20ac7.85 per euro invested (Deloitte, 2017), which we adjust by a corrective factor of 0.48 to reflect the average of other studies (ratio 0.43/0.9 between the average impact and that of the reference study).\\nCalculation: \u20ac33 billion (communication investment) \xd7 7.85 (GDP factor) \xd7 0.48 (corrective factor) = **\u20ac125.2 billion** of additional consumption generated by communication in France.\\n\\n**Step 2: Conversion to carbon intensity**\\n\\nWe calculate the average carbon intensity of French GDP by dividing national emissions by GDP:\\n- National emissions 2023: 373 MtCO\u2082e (CITEPA, 2024)\\n- French GDP 2023: \u20ac2,822.5 billion (INSEE, 2024) \\n\\nYielding an intensity of **0.13 kgCO\u2082e per euro of GDP.**\\n\\n**Step 3: Calculation of the indirect footprint**\\n\\nBy applying this carbon intensity to the generated consumption: \u20ac125.2 billion \xd7 0.13 kgCO\u2082e/\u20ac = **16.55 MtCO\u2082e** This indirect footprint represents approximately **4.44% of the French national carbon footprint**, or more than 16 times the direct impact of the sector.  \\nThis result underlines the critical importance of considering the influence of communication on consumption behaviors when evaluating its overall environmental impact.\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion: Transforming Communication into a Lever for Ecological Transition\\n\\nOur study reveals a fundamental truth for the communication industry: with 94% of its carbon impact coming from indirect effects versus only 6% from direct impact, the sector must profoundly rethink its contribution to the ecological transition. This disproportion, robust even in our most conservative sensitivity analyses, demonstrates that eco-designing campaigns, while necessary, cannot suffice given the scale of the challenge.\\nThe real issue lies in the strategic orientation of the \u20ac125.2 billion of additional consumption generated each year by the sector in France. How can this considerable influence be transformed into a positive force for the planet?\\n\\nAt Ekimetrics, we have developed the MM4S (Marketing Mix for Sustainability) methodology to precisely answer this question. Our approach quantifies and optimizes the dual dimension of marketing:\\n- Its traditional commercial performance\\n- Its overall environmental impact\\n\\nOur analyses demonstrate that a strategic reallocation of marketing budgets can simultaneously improve sales and reduce the carbon footprint. In practice, this means:\\n- Reducing advertising pressure on high-impact products\\n- Accelerating the visibility of sustainable offerings\\n- Objectively quantifying marketing\'s contribution to the company\'s environmental objectives\\n\\nAt a time when regulations are rapidly evolving, this data-driven approach allows companies to anticipate future constraints while transforming their communication into a real lever for ecological transition. Because the message is clear: communication can no longer be content with greening its image \u2013 it must become a measurable catalyst for the transformation of our consumption patterns.\\n\\nFaced with this observation, professionals in the sector now have the opportunity to reinvent their profession, combining marketing expertise and environmental responsibility. It is this new paradigm that Ekimetrics accompanies, with concrete solutions to measure, pilot, and optimize the global impact of your marketing investments.\\n\\n\\n## Cited Works\\n\\nArcom.

In a world where ecological transition has become imperative, no sector can escape scrutiny of its environmental impact - and communication is no exception, being directly and indirectly responsible for 5% of French emissions.\\n\\nOur research, of which we present the first part here, aims to break down and analyze the carbon footprint of the communication industry. This analysis is structured around two complementary publications:\\n\\nIn this first article, we establish the conceptual foundations necessary to understand the complexity of the sector\'s environmental impact. We explore the crucial distinction between direct and indirect effects, before delving into the various mechanisms through which communication influences our consumption behaviors. This theoretical framework is essential for grasping the true environmental challenges facing the sector.\\n\\nThe second part will focus on precisely quantifying these impacts through a rigorous methodology. We will reveal data on the carbon impact of communication in France, showing orders of magnitude that could transform our perception of this sector\'s role in the climate crisis.\\n\\nTogether, these two articles offer a holistic understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing the communication industry considering the climate emergency. Because while understanding is the first step, precise measurement is the essential prerequisite for any effective action.\\n\\n## A Dual Impact\\n\\nThe environmental impact of communication breaks down into two main effects, fundamentally different in their nature and scale:\\n\\n- **Direct emissions**: linked to the consumption and purchases necessary for the creation and distribution of communications. These correspond, for example, to the pollution generated by powering advertising servers and printing posters.\\n- **Indirect emissions**: resulting from changes in consumption and behaviors caused by these communications. Advertising contributes to expanding market sizes, and consequently the production of polluting goods.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Dual_Impact_Comm/Breakdown_marketing_impact_table.png)\\n*Figure 1 : Breakdown of marketing impact (Ekimetrics, 2023)*\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nThis distinction is key to properly understanding the environmental responsibility of the sector. Let\'s examine each of these dimensions in more detail.\\n\\nHowever, be careful, the notion of scope 4 is often used to refer to these indirect emissions. This doesn\'t make sense because indirect emissions are related to emissions that the company records in its scopes 1, 2, and 3 to produce the goods and services sold thanks to marketing. However, these emissions could have been avoided if marketing had promoted other less emissive products or not promoted products at all.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Dual_Impact_Comm/Contribution_graph.png)\\n*Figure 2 : Contribution of direct and indirect impact to a company\'s carbon footprint*\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nLet\'s look at each of these elements in more detail:\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n## Direct Impact: A Highly Structured Area in France with Ongoing Internationalization\\n\\nUnlike the indirect impact, still largely unexplored, the direct impact of communication benefits from growing attention and significant standardization efforts in methodology to quantify environmental impacts. These efforts focus on establishing consistent measurement frameworks and assessment protocols across the industry.\\n\\n### French Professionalization of Measurement\\nFrance is at the forefront of this structuring, with an ecosystem of specialized tools according to communication sectors. It\'s interesting to distinguish between work done to evaluate emissions due to production and those related to message distribution:\\n\\n### Production: France Conditions its Aid on Environmental Assessment\\nIn the field of audiovisual production, several calculators have been approved by the National Center for Cinema (CNC):\\n- [SeCO2](https://www.flyingsecoya.com/) developed by Secoya Eco-tournage, allowing measurement of the footprint of live-action productions.\\n- [Carbon\' Clap](https://ecoprod.com/) created by the Ecoprod association, a pioneer in this field.\\n- [Carbon Stage](https://greenly.earth/) designed by the company Greenly.\\n\\nThe animation sector is also well represented with [Carbulator](https://www.animfrance.fr/), developed by Anim France, while the video game industry has  [Jyros](https://www.gameonly.org/), created by Game Only. This structuring is accompanied by progressive institutionalization: the CNC now conditions certain subsidies on conducting environmental impact analyses, strongly encouraging the adoption of these practices.\\n\\n### Distribution: Towards Standardization of Methods\\n\\nOn the communication distribution side, professional unions and audience measurers such as [SRI](https://www.sri.fr/sri/fr/) or [SNPTV](https://www.admtv.org/communiques/le-snptv-publie-son-referentiel-methodologique-pour-la-mesure-de-lempreinte-carbone-de-la-diffusion-des-campagnes-publicitaires-en-tv-lineaire/) are developing calculators to homogenize data collection and impact analysis. Among advertisers, the Union Des Marques (UDM) is taking a step back and proposing to aggregate these initiatives in a [meta-framework](https://uniondesmarques.fr/nos-services/actualit%C3%A9s/article/2023/06/29/LUnion-des-marques-lance-son-m%C3%A9ta-r%C3%A9f%C3%A9rentiel-sur-la-mesure-de-limpact-carbone-des-campagnes-de-communication) intended to harmonize and make visible all these tools (Press: [SEPM](https://www.lapressemagazine.fr/actualite/presse-magazine-sengage-le-climat-le-sepm-lance-eco-impact-sepm-calculateur-dempreinte), Digital: [SRI](https://www.sri.fr/sri/fr/), Radio: [Bureau de la Radio](https://d-k.io/media/pages/ressources/referentiel-bureau-de-la-radio/3155003852-1690875731/radio-et-audio-referentiel-calcul-empreinte-carbone-diffusion-campagnes-publicitaires-radio-audio-vdef.pdf), TV: [SNPTV](https://www.admtv.org/communiques/le-snptv-publie-son-referentiel-methodologique-pour-la-mesure-de-lempreinte-carbone-de-la-diffusion-des-campagnes-publicitaires-en-tv-lineaire/), outdoor: [UPE](https://carbone-calculateur-adoohcc.upe.fr/\u2026))\\n\\n### An Internationalizing Dynamic\\nThis French movement is rapidly extending internationally. The multiplication of specialized third parties measuring environmental footprint ([Scope 3](https://scope3.com/), [I-Care](https://icare.com/), [DK](https://d-k.io/en), [ALICE developed by Publicis](https://alice.publicisgroupe.com/fr/), [Ekimetrics](https://www.ekimetrics.com/fr)) has led to the birth of a global initiative: [Add Net Zero](https://adnetzero.com/). This coalition aims to harmonize methodologies and create a global standard for the communication industry. Digital giants are also beginning to integrate these concerns. For example, Google now publishes information on the carbon footprint of its advertising campaigns.\\n\\n### A Persistent Blind Spot\\nDespite these significant advances, a fundamental dimension remains absent from current frameworks: the impact of the message conveyed. Existing tools focus exclusively on production and distribution processes, neglecting the effect of content on consumption behaviors.  \\nThis gap is problematic because our conceptual analysis suggests that this indirect impact could far exceed that of direct operations. Precisely measuring the carbon footprint of a filming or the energy consumption of a digital campaign is necessary but insufficient to understand the overall environmental responsibility of the sector. That\'s why we want to address it as an equally important subject to indirect impact.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n## Indirect Effect: The Hidden Power of Communication on Our Consumption Choices\\n\\nThe indirect impact of communication represents a complex ecosystem of intertwined influences on our consumption behaviors. Far from being monolithic, this impact unfolds through several distinct mechanisms, forming a web of influences with varied environmental consequences.\\n\\n\\n### The Triptych of Advertising Impact\\nOur analysis of scientific literature has allowed us to identify three fundamental mechanisms through which communication modifies consumption behaviors:\\n\\n**The (adverse) redistribution effect** postulates that the market is a zero-sum game and that advertising changes the distribution of demand among brands. When a car brand communicates effectively, it can attract 100 customers who would otherwise have bought from a competitor, without increasing the total number of vehicles sold (Dubois et al., 2018). It\'s a transfer of market share without modification of the overall volume of sales.\\n\\n**The growth effect** represents the ability of communication to extend the boundaries of the market itself. A campaign for smartphones can convince consumers who had not planned to buy a new device this year to take the plunge, thus creating additional demand that would not have existed without this communication.\\n\\n**The price effect**, particularly subtle, leads advertising to transform the perception of value and price sensitivity (Erdem et al., 2008). Premium communication for organic coffee can simultaneously justify a higher price for certain consumers (potentially decreasing the volume sold) while drawing attention to the entire category, stimulating price sensitivity and sometimes pushing competitors\' prices downward (thus increasing the overall volume).\\n\\n\\n### Radically Different Environmental Consequences\\nThese three effects are compatible with brands\' objective of maximizing profitability. However, they fundamentally diverge in their environmental implications:\\n\\n**The redistribution effect**, although seemingly neutral since it does not modify the overall volume of consumption, can nevertheless lead to significant indirect consequences. If an SUV manufacturer captures market share at the expense of a manufacturer of low-consumption city cars, the overall carbon impact increases without any additional cars being sold. This effect reveals the ability of communication to redirect consumption flows between products with different carbon footprints.\\n\\n**The growth effect** constitutes the most directly problematic mechanism from an environmental perspective. Each additional act of consumption represents a new drain on planetary resources and new greenhouse gas emissions. The effectiveness of communication in generating additional demand then becomes a direct amplifier of environmental pressure.\\n\\n**The price effect** presents a fundamental ambivalence. On one hand, communication can help valorize sustainable products, justifying a price premium that finances ecological innovation. On the other hand, by making consumers less sensitive to price, it can democratize access to certain high-impact product categories, increasing their diffusion. The directionality of this effect fundamentally depends on the nature of the products promoted.\\n\\n\\n### Towards an Operational Analytical Framework\\nTo establish a rigorous conceptual framework for the indirect impact of communication, we must recognize these nuances while keeping in mind the objective of a practical assessment. The redistribution effect, although important for understanding market dynamics, presents an apparent neutrality that can be misleading when applied to products with different environmental footprints. The price effect, meanwhile, would require detailed econometric data to be properly evaluated.\\n\\nThis complexity reminds us that any measure of the environmental impact of communication must integrate not only the volume of consumption generated, but also the nature of the products and services promoted, as well as their alternatives in the market.\\n\\nIn the second part of our article, we try to quantify the [Impact of Communication on Our Carbon Footprint](http://localhost:8080/blog/Quantifying_Impact_Communication)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAt the end of this analysis, one observation stands out: the iceberg of the environmental impact of communication shows only its tip. With only 6% direct impact against 94% indirect impact, we must fundamentally rethink our approach to the sector.\\n\\nIn our next article, we will dive into the precise figures and methodologies that allow us to quantify this impact, revealing how communication could become a major lever for ecological transition rather than an accelerator of unsustainable consumption.\\n\\nThe question that awaits us is crucial: how to transform a sector whose historical purpose has been to stimulate consumption into a catalyst for sobriety?\\n\\n\\n## Works Cited\\n\\nArcom.

Instead of simply revealing why a model made a particular decision, counterfactuals show how to change the outcome, bridging the gap between algorithmic decisions and human understanding.  \\nIn this article, we explore what counterfactuals explanations are, why they matter, how they can be generated, and their future role in explainable AI (XAI).\\n\\n## I. What is a Counterfactual Explanation in Machine Learning?\\n\\nCounterfactual explanations (or simply counterfactuals) describe how modifying specific input features could lead to a different model outcome. They provide minimal, actionable changes that would flip a prediction. They can be generated for both classification and regression problems. In the literature, the majority of studies have focused on classification problems, where counterfactuals suggest feature modifications to change a categorical outcome. Regression-based counterfactuals are now gaining more attention while facing specific issues related to continuous variable outcomes.\\n\\nExamples of Counterfactuals:\\n\\n- **Classification Example (Loan Approval)**: If a model predicts that a loan application is denied, a counterfactual might suggest that increasing the applicant\u2019s income by $10,000 or reducing their existing debt by $5,000 could change the outcome to approved.\\n\\n- **Regression Example (House Price Prediction)**: If a model estimates a house\'s value at $300,000, a counterfactual might suggest that increasing the lot size by 500 square feet or adding an extra bedroom could raise the predicted price to $350,000.\\n\\nUnlike traditional interpretability techniques which highlight which features most influence a prediction, counterfactuals focus on how to change the outcome. Feature importance methods can be categorized into global and local approaches: global feature importance (e.g., Gini index) assesses the overall impact of each feature on the model across all predictions, while local feature importance (e.g., SHAP) explains the contribution of features to a specific instance\u2019s prediction. Counterfactuals, in contrast, provide instance-specific insights by suggesting changes needed to obtain a different outcome.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n- Global feature importance tells us that income and credit score are the most important factors in a loan decision in general, not for a specific instance.\\n- SHAP quantifies how much each feature contributed to the final prediction.\\n- Counterfactuals go a step further by suggesting precise changes, such as increasing income by $10,000 to get the loan approved.\\n\\nThis focus on actionability makes counterfactual explanations particularly valuable when users need clear next steps, rather than just a breakdown of feature contributions.\\n\\n\\n## II. Why Counterfactuals Matter in Machine Learning\\n\\nCounterfactual explanations can enhance AI transparency and fairness by addressing several key challenges:\\n\\n#### Actionable Insights\\n\\nAs mentioned, unlike traditional explainability methods that only highlight influential features, counterfactuals provide clear, practical steps to achieve a desired outcome. Instead of just showing that income is important for loan approval, counterfactuals tell users exactly how much income needs to increase for approval.\\n\\n#### Trust and Compliance\\n\\nAs AI systems play a growing role in decision-making, [regulations require that automated decisions be explainable and fair](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3593013.3594069). Counterfactuals help organizations justify decisions by demonstrating the exact changes that would have led to a different outcome.\\n\\nThis improves:\\n- **Transparency** \u2013 Users understand why they received a particular decision.\\n- **Fairness** \u2013 Decision-making processes become more accountable.\\n- **Trust** \u2013 People are more likely to accept AI-driven outcomes if they can see how decisions are made.\\n\\n#### Model Debugging and Bias Detection\\n\\nCounterfactuals also help developers detect biases in machine learning models.\\nFor example, if certain demographic groups need unrealistically high increases in income to get loan approvals, this may indicate a hidden bias in the model. By analyzing these patterns, developers can:\\n\\n- Identify fairness issues\\n- Refine the model to reduce bias\\n- Improve model reliability and robustness\\n\\nBy providing actionable recommendations, ensuring regulatory compliance, and improving model fairness, counterfactual explanations are essential for building trustworthy AI systems.\\n\\n\\n## III. Generating Counterfactuals: DiCE and MACE\\n\\nCounterfactual generation is a key step in understanding and improving machine learning models. Two widely used methods for generating counterfactuals are DiCE (Diverse Counterfactual Explanations) and MACE (Model-Agnostic Counterfactual Explanations with Constraints).\\n\\n\\n#### DiCE (Diverse Counterfactual Explanations)\\n\\n[DiCE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07697), developed by Microsoft Research, is a powerful tool for generating diverse counterfactual explanations in machine learning. Unlike traditional counterfactual methods that focus on finding a single optimal explanation, DiCE emphasizes the importance of providing multiple, diverse alternatives.\\n\\n#### Key Features of DiCE:\\n\\n1.\\tModel-Agnostic Approach: DiCE can work with any black-box model, making it versatile across different machine learning architectures.\\n2.\\tDiversity in Explanations: It generates a set of counterfactuals that are meaningfully different from each other, offering a broader perspective on possible changes.\\n3.\\tCustomizable Constraints: Users can specify feature ranges and immutability, ensuring the generated counterfactuals are realistic and actionable.\\n4.\\tMultiple Generation Methods: DiCE employs various techniques including genetic algorithms, random sampling, and KD-tree search to efficiently explore the feature space.\\n5.\\tScalability: It\'s designed to handle large datasets and complex models efficiently.\\n\\n\\nDiCE solves a key limitation of single-counterfactual methods by offering multiple alternative solutions, which is especially useful when there are different ways to achieve the same outcome. This variety not only helps users explore more actionable options but also provides a clearer picture of the model\u2019s decision boundaries.\\nThat said, while DiCE is a major step forward in explainable AI, it isn\u2019t perfect without the right constraints, it can sometimes suggest unrealistic changes. That\u2019s why domain expertise is essential for setting meaningful boundaries and making sense of the results.\\n\\nTo better understand how DiCE works in practice, here is an example in Python demonstrating how to generate counterfactual explanations using a trained machine learning model:\\n\\n```python\\nimport dice_ml \\nfrom dice_ml import Dice\\n\\n# Initialize a DiCE explainer with dataset details and model constraints\\nd = dice_ml.Data(dataframe=X_train, \\n                 continuous_features=numerical_features, \\n                 outcome_name=target,\\n                 permitted_range=permitted_ranges)\\n\\n# Wrap the trained model for use with DiCE\\nm = dice_ml.Model(model=model, backend=\\"sklearn\\")\\n\\n# Create a DiCE explainer instance\\nexp = Dice(d, m)\\n\\n# Select a single test instance (excluding the target column)\\nquery_instance = X_test.drop(columns=[target]).iloc[0:1]\\n\\n# Generate counterfactual explanations for the selected instance\\ncounterfactuals = exp.generate_counterfactuals(query_instance, \\n                                               total_CFs=5,  # Number of counterfactual examples to generate\\n                                               desired_class=\\"opposite\\",  # Flip the predicted class\\n                                               features_to_vary=actionable_features)  # Features allowed to change\\n\\n# Display counterfactuals, showing only feature differences\\ncounterfactuals.visualize_as_dataframe(show_only_changes=True)\\n```\\n<br/>\\n\\n#### MACE (Model-Agnostic Counterfactual Explanations with Constraints)\\n\\n[MACE (Model-Agnostic Counterfactual Explanations)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.15540) is an advanced approach to generating counterfactual explanations in machine learning, with a primary focus on ensuring the realism and feasibility of the generated explanations.\\n\\n#### Key features of MACE\\n\\n1.\\tConstraint Integration: MACE incorporates domain-specific constraints directly into the counterfactual generation process. This ensures that all suggested changes are not only mathematically valid but also practically feasible and logically consistent.\\n2.\\tModel Agnosticism: Like other counterfactual methods, MACE can work with any type of machine learning model, making it versatile across different applications and model architectures.\\n3.\\tPlausibility Enforcement: MACE prevents the generation of impossible or unrealistic counterfactuals. For instance, it won\'t suggest changes like reducing age or altering immutable characteristics.\\n4.\\tCustomizable Rules: Users can define specific constraints tailored to their domain, allowing for fine-grained control over what types of changes are considered acceptable.\\n5.\\tHandling Complex Data Types: MACE is designed to work effectively with both numerical and categorical features, addressing the challenges posed by mixed data types in real-world datasets.\\n\\nMACE stands out for its ability to generate realistic and actionable explanations. However, this realism comes at a cost. MACE is more computationally intensive than simpler counterfactual methods because it solves complex optimization problems with constraints.\\nDespite this, MACE has proven highly valuable in situations where explanation credibility and regulatory compliance matter most.\\nThat said, the quality of MACE\u2019s explanations still depends on well-defined constraints and high-quality data. Without these, even the most advanced counterfactual method can produce misleading or unhelpful results.\\n\\nTo better understand how MACE works in practice, here is an example in Python demonstrating how to generate counterfactual explanations using a trained machine learning model:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom omnixai.data.tabular import Tabular\\nfrom omnixai.preprocessing.tabular import TabularTransform\\nfrom omnixai.explainers.tabular import MACEExplainer\\n\\n# Load the dataset into an OmnixAI Tabular object\\ntabular_data = Tabular(df,\\n    feature_columns=feature_names,  # List of feature column names\\n    categorical_columns=categorical_features,  # Specify categorical features\\n    target_column=target  # Specify the target variable\\n)\\n\\n# Fit a tabular transformer for preprocessing (e.g., encoding, scaling)\\ntransformer = TabularTransform().fit(tabular_data)\\nclass_names = transformer.class_names  # Get class labels from the transformer\\n\\n# Define a prediction function that applies the model after transformation\\npredict_function = lambda z: model.predict_proba(transformer.transform(z))\\n\\n# Initialize the MACE counterfactual explainer\\nmaceexplainer = MACEExplainer(\\n    training_data=tabular_data,  # Provide the training dataset\\n    predict_function=predict_function,  # Use the defined prediction function\\n    ignored_features=features_to_ignore  # Specify features that should not be modified\\n)\\n\\n# Select test instances (excluding the target column) for explanation\\ntest_instances = tabular_data.remove_target_column()[0:5]\\n\\n# Generate counterfactual explanations for the selected test instances\\nexplanations = maceexplainer.explain(test_instances)\\n\\n# Visualize the counterfactual explanation for the first test instance\\nexplanations.ipython_plot(index=0, class_names=class_names)\\n```\\n\\n\\n#### Example of MACE Application to the Give Me Some Credit Dataset\\n\\nTo demonstrate how MACE can be used in a real-world setting, we applied it to the well-known [Give Me Some Credit dataset from Kaggle](https://github.com/DrIanGregory/Kaggle-GiveMeSomeCredit). This dataset was originally used in a 2011 competition to predict the likelihood of a borrower becoming seriously delinquent (90+ days late on a payment) within two years.\\n\\n\\n#### Dataset Overview\\n\\nThe dataset includes over 250,000 anonymized credit records, split into 150,000 training examples and 101,503 test instances. The target variable is SeriousDlqin2yrs (1 = default, 0 = no default), and each record contains 10 explanatory variables that capture an individual\u2019s credit behavior, income, and financial obligations. Key features include:\\n\\n- RevolvingUtilizationOfUnsecuredLines: Utilization ratio of unsecured lines (e.g., credit cards)\\n- DebtRatio: Proportion of debt relative to income\\n- MonthlyIncome: Self-reported monthly income\\n- NumberOfOpenCreditLinesAndLoans: Total number of credit lines and loans\\n- NumberOfTimes90DaysLate: Frequency of severe delinquency\\n\\n\\n#### Model Training\\n\\nFor this case study, we used XGBoost, a gradient boosting algorithm known for its ability to handle structured data and capture nonlinear relationships. XGBoost was trained on the preprocessed training data to predict the likelihood of loan default (SeriousDlqin2yrs).\\n\\nAfter training, we applied MACE to generate counterfactual explanations for individuals predicted as high risk (i.e., default = 1). The goal was to understand what minimal and realistic changes could flip their classification to non-default.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Counter_Factual/Table.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\n\\nTwo counterfactuals were generated for the individual originally predicted to default (label = 1). The original instance had a DebtRatio of 0.803 and a MonthlyIncome of 9120.0. The first counterfactual (CF 1) keeps the DebtRatio constant at 0.803 but increases the MonthlyIncome to 9422.625, resulting in a predicted label of 0 (non-default). The second counterfactual (CF 2) achieves the same label flip by simultaneously lowering the DebtRatio to 0.7993 and raising the MonthlyIncome to 9422.625. This demonstrates that modest, realistic adjustments to financial metrics can alter risk classification, highlighting specific and actionable paths to improve creditworthiness.\\n\\n## IV. The Future of Counterfactuals and Explainable AI\\n\\nCounterfactual explanations are becoming an increasingly important tool for AI transparency and decision-making. As the field evolves, several key trends are shaping their future.\\n\\nOne major shift is the integration of causal reasoning into counterfactual methods. Instead of simply answering \\"what-if\\" questions, future approaches will identify real cause-and-effect relationships, helping distinguish meaningful factors from random correlations. This will make counterfactual explanations more reliable and actionable.\\n\\nAnother important development is the move toward automated constraints. Rather than relying on manually defined rules, new techniques will learn realistic constraints directly from data. This will ensure that counterfactual suggestions remain practical and achievable without requiring extensive human oversight.\\n\\nDespite these advancements, challenges remain especially in scaling counterfactual methods for complex models like transformers and ensuring they work effectively across different languages and cultures.\\n\\nTo address these issues, we have been developing a counterfactual generator that prioritizes plausibility and proximity. By ensuring that suggested changes are both realistic and within the distribution, our approach aims to provide users with more trustworthy insights into AI-driven decisions.\\n\\nCounterfactuals are playing a key role in shifting AI from an opaque \\"black box\\" to a transparent, user-friendly system. By making machine learning more explainable, accountable, and actionable, they will help shape the future of ethical and trustworthy AI.\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"Causal_Inference","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Causal_Inference","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-31-Causal_Inference.md","title":"MMM Opportunities of Using Causal Inference","description":"Integrating causal inference into Marketing Mix Models transforms correlation-based marketing analytics into powerful decision engines that reveal the true impact of campaigns.","date":"2025-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 31, 2025","tags":[{"label":"Causal AI","permalink":"/blog/tags/causal-ai"},{"label":"Explainable Marketing","permalink":"/blog/tags/explainable-marketing"},{"label":"MMM","permalink":"/blog/tags/mmm"}],"readingTime":9.305,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Toni Fortora","title":"Senior Consultant","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/toni-fortora/","imageURL":"/img/authors/toni_fortora.jpg","key":"toni.fortora"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Causal_Inference","title":"MMM Opportunities of Using Causal Inference","authors":["toni.fortora"],"header_image_url":"img/blog/Causal_Inference_header.jpg","image":"img/blog/Causal_Inference_header.jpg","tags":["Causal AI","Explainable Marketing","MMM"],"draft":false,"description":"Integrating causal inference into Marketing Mix Models transforms correlation-based marketing analytics into powerful decision engines that reveal the true impact of campaigns.","keywords":["Marketing Mix Modeling","Causal inference","Indirect effect","Attribution modeling","Marketing ROI causality","Channel interaction effects","Confounding variables marketing","DoWhy","Counterfactuals"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Counterfactual Explanations: Enhancing Machine Learning Transparency and Delivering Actionable Insights","permalink":"/blog/Counterfactual_Explanations"},"nextItem":{"title":"How We Created Our First Talk-to-Data (Text-to-SQL) Application in Production","permalink":"/blog/Talk_to_Data_App"}},"content":"\x3c!-- import useBaseUrl from \\"@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\\";\\r\\n\\r\\n<link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"{useBaseUrl(\'katex/katex.min.css\')}\\" />\\r\\n --\x3e\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n# Marketing Mix Modeling: Opportunities of Using Causal Inference\\r\\n\\r\\nMarketing Mix Modeling (MMM) has served as a foundational methodology for quantifying marketing effectiveness for decades. Its enduring relevance stems from its ability to provide aggregate insights across channels without relying on individual-level tracking. In today\'s privacy-centric landscape, this advantage has become even more valuable.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, as marketing ecosystems grow increasingly complex, traditional MMM frameworks face new challenges in capturing the true dynamics of modern campaigns. This isn\'t to suggest that classical MMM approaches are obsolete\u2014quite the contrary. Instead, we propose that integrating causal inference methodologies can enhance and extend these proven frameworks, addressing their limitations while preserving their strengths.\\r\\n\\r\\n## The Causal Nature of Marketing ROI  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen any ad designer or CMO asks, \\"What was the return on investment of our TV campaign?\\", they are not simply inquiring about correlation \u2013 they\'re asking a causal question. In statistical terms, they\'re seeking to measure the effect of TV advertising spend on sales. This is the so-called Average Treatment Effect (ATE) in the causal inference field of study. More specifically, they might want to understand this effect for:\\r\\n- Specific time periods or conditions\\r\\n- Weeks or campaigns\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of these questions are trying to explain the true incremental impact of marketing activities on business outcomes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditional MMM approaches typically employ regression techniques to model the relationship between marketing activities and business outcomes. These models have delivered substantial value by:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Quantifying Channel Contributions**: Estimating the impact of different marketing channels on sales or other KPIs\\r\\n2. **Optimizing Budget Allocation**: Providing guidance on how to distribute marketing investments\\r\\n3. **Forecasting Outcomes**: Predicting the likely impact of planned marketing activities\\r\\n\\r\\nThese capabilities remain valuable, and the established MMM ecosystem offers robust tools for addressing fundamental marketing measurement questions. However, classical approaches often make simplifying assumptions that can limit their accuracy in certain contexts.\\r\\n\\r\\n## The Independence Assumption Bait\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile traditional regression models might seem sufficient when input variables are independent, real-world marketing data rarely satisfies this condition. Marketing plans are typically optimized to maximize sales, creating inherent correlations between channels and activities. This interdependence introduces several critical biases:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Selection Bias**: Advertisers naturally allocate more budget to channels that historically perform well, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy in the data.\\r\\n- **Temporal Confounding**: Seasonal effects and marketing calendar events influence both advertising decisions and sales outcomes.\\r\\n- **Channel Interaction Effects**: Marketing channels don\'t operate in isolation but influence and reinforce each other, creating complex causal pathways.\\r\\n\\r\\nRather than replacing traditional MMM, causal inference methodologies can be integrated to address specific limitations while building upon the existing foundation. This integration helps solve several persistent challenges:\\r\\n\\r\\n### Challenge 1: Confounding Variables\\r\\n\\r\\nClassical MMM struggles when unobserved factors influence both marketing decisions and outcomes. For example, a company might increase TV advertising during periods of expected high demand (holidays), making it difficult to disentangle the true impact of advertising from the seasonal effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nCausal inference explicitly models these confounding relationships:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\n# Traditional approach might look like:\\r\\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\\r\\n\\r\\n# Simplified regression model treating all variables as independent\\r\\nmodel = sm.OLS(sales, [tv_spend, digital_spend, search_spend, email_spend, seasonality]).fit()\\r\\n\\r\\n# Causal approach explicitly models the confounding structure:\\r\\nfrom dowhy import CausalModel\\r\\nimport networkx as nx\\r\\n\\r\\n# Create a graph showing both direct effects and confounding relationships\\r\\ng = nx.DiGraph()\\r\\n\\r\\n# Add nodes for all variables\\r\\ng.add_nodes_from([\'TV_Spend\', \'Digital_Spend\', \'Search_Spend\', \'Email_Spend\', \'Seasonality\', \'Sales\'])\\r\\n\\r\\n# Add direct effects on sales\\r\\ng.add_edges_from([\\r\\n    (\'TV_Spend\', \'Sales\'),\\r\\n    (\'Digital_Spend\', \'Sales\'),\\r\\n    (\'Search_Spend\', \'Sales\'),\\r\\n    (\'Email_Spend\', \'Sales\')\\r\\n])\\r\\n\\r\\n# Add confounding relationships (seasonality affects both marketing and sales)\\r\\ng.add_edges_from([\\r\\n    (\'Seasonality\', \'TV_Spend\'),\\r\\n    (\'Seasonality\', \'Digital_Spend\'),\\r\\n    (\'Seasonality\', \'Sales\')\\r\\n])\\r\\n\\r\\n# Add channel interaction effects (TV drives search behavior)\\r\\ng.add_edges_from([\\r\\n    (\'TV_Spend\', \'Search_Spend\')\\r\\n])\\r\\n\\r\\n# Create causal model for a specific treatment (TV_Spend in this example)\\r\\ncausal_model = CausalModel(\\r\\n    data=df,\\r\\n    treatment=\'TV_Spend\',\\r\\n    outcome=\'Sales\',\\r\\n    graph=g\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nBy explicitly modeling this causal structure, we can obtain unbiased estimates of the true effect of TV advertising, isolated from seasonal influences.\\r\\n\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\r\\n\\r\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Causal_Inference/causal_graph_example.jpg)\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\r\\n\\r\\n### Challenge 2: Channel Interactions and Spillover Effects\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditional models often treat marketing channels as independent contributors, but modern marketing ecosystems are characterized by complex interactions. TV advertising might boost search volume, social media campaigns might amplify email effectiveness, and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nCausal modeling allows us to represent these dependencies mathematically:\\r\\n\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\r\\n\\r\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Causal_Inference/Latex_1.png)\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div align = \\"left\\">\\r\\nwhere\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Causal_Inference/Latex_2.png)\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">  \\r\\n\\r\\nrepresents the indirect effect of TV advertising on sales via its influence on search behavior. This captures the reality that when TV campaigns run, they often drive consumers to search for the product or brand online, creating an indirect pathway to conversion. By modeling these pathways explicitly, we can attribute effects more accurately and understand both direct and indirect impacts of each marketing channel.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Challenge 3: Non-Random Media Allocation\\r\\n\\r\\nMarketing investments aren\'t randomly assigned\u2014they\'re strategically allocated based on past performance, creating a form of selection bias. This can lead to misleading conclusions when using traditional regression approaches.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe potential outcomes framework from causal inference helps address this by explicitly considering counterfactuals:\\r\\n\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div align = \\"left\\">\\r\\n\\r\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Causal_Inference/Latex_3.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere\\r\\n\\r\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Causal_Inference/tau_alone.png)\\r\\n  is the Average Treatment Effect\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\r\\n\\r\\nY(1) is the outcome with treatment, and \\r\\n\\r\\nY(0) is the outcome without treatment. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis framework forces us to consider what would have happened without a particular marketing intervention, providing a more accurate measure of true incremental impact.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Moving Toward Causal Solutions\\r\\n\\r\\nTo address these challenges at Ekimetrics, we\'ve developed a hybrid approach that integrates causal inference into the classical MMM pipeline. By introducing a causal graph, we incorporate human expertise into the model, allowing us to explicitly represent and validate the relationships between variables. This step transforms MMM from a correlation-based tool into a causality-driven framework capable of uncovering adjusted marketing effectiveness.\\r\\n\\r\\n### MMM Preprocessing\\r\\n\\r\\nBegin with established MMM preprocessing techniques:\\r\\n- Adstock transformations to capture carryover effects\\r\\n- Saturation functions to model diminishing returns\\r\\n- Seasonality adjustments to account for cyclical patterns\\r\\n\\r\\n### Building a Causal Graph\\r\\n\\r\\nNext, we build a causal graph that visualizes relationships between variables. Unlike traditional approaches, this step embeds domain expertise directly into the model. For instance, media_X might depend on media_Y, media_Z. Our causal graph explicitly encodes this dependency and establishes direct and indirect paths to the outcome variable.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Validating Relationships\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the causal structure is in place, we validate it through a combination of rigorous methods to ensure robustness and credibility:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Independence Tests**  \\r\\n  We run statistical independence tests, such as the Chi-squared test, to verify whether the proposed relationships in the causal graph hold true in the data. These tests help confirm that the dependencies between variables are statistically significant and align with the causal structure.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Overlap Testing**  \\r\\n  When conditioning on specific variables (e.g., during causal discovery or effect estimation), it\'s crucial to ensure sufficient data points remain for robust analysis. We carefully assess data quantity and overlap to avoid issues of sparsity that could compromise the validity of the results. This step ensures that the model remains reliable even after stratifying or subsetting the data.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Quantifying Causal Effects\\r\\n\\r\\nTo understand the impact of each media campaign on sales, we use tools like DoWhy to estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) for each media variable. The ATE provides a quantitative measure of how much a given campaign influences sales, both directly and indirectly.\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\n# For each channel, identify proper adjustment variables\\r\\nidentified_estimand = model.identify_effect(treatment=\'TV_Spend\',\\r\\n                                           outcome=\'Sales\')\\r\\n\\r\\n# Estimate causal effect using a method that leverages traditional MMM strengths\\r\\ncausal_estimate = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,\\r\\n                                      method_name=\\"backdoor.linear_regression\\")\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis analysis also helps uncover synergies and spillover effects between variables, shedding light on how different campaigns interact with each other to drive outcomes.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Ensuring Robustness\\r\\n\\r\\nValidation is a critical step in ensuring the reliability and practical utility of our causal model. Rather than simply accepting point estimates, we systematically quantify the uncertainty associated with our causal effect measurements\u2014an approach that enhances both analytical rigor and decision-making transparency.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe employ several complementary techniques to measure uncertainty:\\r\\n- **Confidence Intervals**: Using bootstrapping approaches to generate confidence intervals around our Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimates. This provides stakeholders with a clear understanding of the range within which the true causal effect likely falls.\\r\\n- **Hypothesis Testing**: Calculating p-values that indicate the statistical significance of identified effects, helping differentiate between genuine causal relationships and potential statistical noises.\\r\\n- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Systematically varying model assumptions to understand how robust our causal estimates are to different specifications and data conditions.\\r\\n  \\r\\nThis focus on uncertainty measurement acknowledges the inherent limitations of causal inference in real-world settings with finite data. We recognize that causal estimates may be imperfect when data volume is limited, measurement noise is present, or when important variables might be unobserved. By transparently communicating these uncertainties, we enable more informed decision-making.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also reconcile the experiment\'s results with Business validation. This involves comparing your causal MMM results against actual experimental data to verify that your model\'s predictions match observed outcomes in controlled settings. This process serves as a reality check that bridges statistical models with empirical evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Conclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nAs marketing ecosystems become increasingly complex, the need for robust causal inference in MMM grows more critical. By acknowledging and addressing the causal nature of marketing effectiveness measurement, we can deliver more accurate and actionable insights to decision-makers.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderstanding MMM as a causal inference problem rather than just a regression task is crucial for modern marketing analytics. This perspective enables more accurate measurement of marketing effectiveness and better-informed decision-making in an increasingly complex digital landscape.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Glossary\\r\\n \\r\\n**Average Treatment Effect (ATE)**  \\r\\nThe mean difference in outcomes between units that received a treatment and units that did not.

Talk to data: a new frontier\\r\\n\\r\\nAs 2023 drew to a close, we made a strategic decision to tackle one of the most promising challenges in data science: enabling natural language interactions with databases, technically known as \\"Text-to-SQL.\\" Our conviction that 2024 would be the breakthrough year for talk-to-data applications was driven by several key developments: the release of GPT-4-turbo, intensifying competition in the AI space, declining implementation costs, expanded context windows, and unprecedented market momentum.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## 2.\\tBusiness Value\\r\\n\\r\\nThe business case for talk-to-data solutions extends beyond technical innovation. We identified 3 primary value propositions that resonated with our first customer:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\r\\n\\r\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Talk_to_Data_App/Use_Cases.png)\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket validation has since strengthened our conviction: for instance, Uber reports a 70% reduction in SQL query authoring time through such tools, translating to an estimated 140,000 hours saved monthly (source: https://medium.com/wrenai/how-uber-is-saving-140-000-hours-each-month-using-text-to-sql-and-how-you-can-harness-the-same-fb4818ae4ea3).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## 3.\\tTechnical Challenges\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYou might wonder: since RAGs have proven effective with LLMs like GPT-3.5, why wouldn\'t they suffice for database interactions? After all, databases are structured in tabular formats, seemingly eliminating the need for parsing, chunking, or preprocessing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, despite the apparent simplicity of structured databases, four significant challenges make this task particularly complex:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\tAmbiguity in Natural Language: varies from one user to another, and one question can have several answers\\r\\n2.\\tComplex SQL syntax: You may need nested queries, aggregations, filters and conditions\\r\\n3.\\tSchema & Naming Understanding: Alignment between the user question, the format of data, the naming of fields, and then the SQL... are not trivial\\r\\n4.\\tError Sensitivity: small errors in SQL lead to invalid queries or incorrect results, unlike natural language, where minor errors are often tolerated.\\r\\n\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\r\\n\\r\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Talk_to_Data_App/Timeline_Performance.png)\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## 4.

Implementation Journey\\r\\n\\r\\n### Architecture & Initial Setup\\r\\n\\r\\nTo begin with, we created an architecture fitting with the client environment & the architects\u2019 requirements.  While the complete technical details are beyond this document\'s scope, here\'s a simplified overview:\\r\\n\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\r\\n\\r\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Talk_to_Data_App/Components.png)\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\r\\n\\r\\nTo launch our work, we reframed the business need: the customer only wanted an application that would enable them to query their database: one question, one answer, directly in the form of data.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe quickly identified a critical challenge: how could business users without SQL expertise or familiarity with the available tables verify the accuracy and relevance of the answers?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo address this issue, we immediately incorporated a natural language reformulation of the SQL query - which only addresses part of the problem, however. And to improve regularly the tool, we integrated human feedback loops through example pairs (question and SQL answer).\\r\\n\\r\\nOur initial implementation included:\\r\\n- A dockerised architecture connecting back and front via FastAPI\\r\\n- Vanna 0.0.3x\\r\\n- A GPT 3.5 turbo (to limit costs on iterations, which proved useful at first)\\r\\n- Access to 2-3 tables in an initially fixed format\\r\\n\\r\\n### Implementation Challenges & Solutions\\r\\n\\r\\nOur work initially consisted of testing and identifying problems, the better to reflect on them and devise solutions. Working with limited-capability LLMs highlighted the importance of robust code and precise prompting. Here are the key challenges we encountered:\\r\\n\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\r\\n\\r\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Talk_to_Data_App/Steps_Q.png)\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe developed several solutions to address these challenges. Below are three key challenges and the solutions we developed:\\r\\n\\r\\n### a/ Problems linked to the database:\\r\\n\\r\\nTo manage problems linked to a change in the data (change of name, addition of field, modality, etc.), we created 3 types of referential that enabled us to observe and integrate table changes as automatically as possible, even when they were not communicated: \\r\\n1.\\tA replica of the data dictionary (Excel) used by the data team, listing the table name, field, type, description and an example of a value.\\r\\n2.\\tA configuration automatically generated from the data available at the time of generation, listing the table schemas (CREATE TABLE ...), and examples of SQL queries automatically translated into natural language, the main purpose of which is to link a word with a field in a table (list the countries France, GB and Germany // SELECT country FROM table_A WHERE country in (\u2018FRA\u2019, \u2018GBR\u2019, \u2018DEU\u2019))\\r\\n3.\\tA repository of field values in STRING format\\r\\n\\r\\nThese repositories do not solve the fundamental problem of data instability and communication problems between teams, but they do provide a clear picture of what is being used, enable alerts to be raised quickly, and allow the most automatic possible adaptation to changes in the databases. Because the best response is above all to have real data governance, quality controls, bodies and processes for validating and communicating changes.\\r\\n\\r\\n### b/ Problems linked to the lack of correspondence between the business language and the database language\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the major difficulty with TTD.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several factors, and therefore several solutions:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Unclear questions**\\r\\n\\r\\n  - Example: what is the price of XXX -> no date, no distinction between new and used, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n  - Solution: \\r\\n    - Add default filters (e.g. most recent date)\\r\\n    - Choose one of several possible tables, and specify this in the SQL query reformulation in natural language.\\r\\n    - Solutions based on a multi-turn discussion with LLM: \\r\\n      - LLM points out the ambiguities of the formulation and asks for clarification\\r\\n      -\\tLLM shows what related data are available, and asks for clarification\\r\\n      - LLM suggests a reformulation, and asks for validation before generating the SQL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Questions that are too specific** \\r\\n  - Example: \u2018What is the price of X on 1 January at 1.03pm according to website Y in region Z?\u2019 when the information is only available on average on a monthly basis.\\r\\n\\r\\n  - Solution: \\r\\n    - In general, the LLM responds as best it can, and rephrasing allows the user to be informed of the level of detail in the response. But be careful, too much detail can lead the LLM to add aberrant filters - which again is visible in the reformulation.\\r\\n    - Solutions based on a multi-turn discussion with LLM (see above)\\r\\n\\r\\n- **An implicit context**\\r\\n\\r\\n  - Example:\\r\\n\\r\\n    - User A, living in France: what is the price of XXX? (implied: in France)\\r\\n    - User B, living in the UK: what is the price of XXX? (implied: in the UK)\\r\\n\\r\\n  - Solutions (not all integrated): \\r\\n\\r\\n    - Personalise the TTD with a simple prompt presenting the user\'s context\\r\\n    - Add default filters based on country, entity, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Unclear field names**\\r\\n\\r\\n  - Example: field names such as \u2018DL_MKT_TIME\u2019. The description of the field allows the LLM to understand it, but the name of the field is very important.\\r\\n  - Solutions: \\r\\n\\r\\n    - Create views dedicated to TTD\\r\\n    - Use a business name in the TTD code, which will be replaced on the fly by its technical name when the request is made.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Jargon in user questions**\\r\\n\\r\\n  - Example: business abbreviations (\u2018bb\u2019 for \u2018buyback\u2019, etc.).\\r\\n\\r\\n  - Solution: \\r\\n\\r\\n    - Specific jargon must necessarily be given to the LLM, either upstream (FT) or in the document base (which feeds the prompt).\\r\\n    - Hybrid search can be used to retrieve specific business vocabulary that is not well represented in the latent vector space.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Table formats (aggregation, filter, etc.) of which the user is unaware, leading to complex or impossible queries**\\r\\n\\r\\n  - Example: \u2018what is the average selling price of X\u2019 on a table aggregated by shop (requiring a weighted average).\\r\\n  - Solutions: \\r\\n\\r\\n    - Information & instructions:\\r\\n\\r\\n      - The description of the tables and fields must be clear about their level of aggregation.\\r\\n      - More examples\\r\\n\\r\\n    - Safeguards: \\r\\n    \\r\\n      - Identify certain patterns in the query, then raise an error with a corrective message for the LLM\\r\\n      - Even on-the-fly replacement of certain operations\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Specific field formats**\\r\\n  - Example: two fields for a single word, several words in one field value, etc.\\r\\n  - Solution: in this case, the best solution is still to change the data. If this isn\'t possible and TTD doesn\'t work as expected, you can use ad-hoc prompts and fairly open SQL queries (e.g. \u2018LIKE\u2019 instead of \u2018=\u2019).\\r\\n\\r\\n### c/ Performance drift & speed of development\\r\\nTo test the performance, a dedicated team of users asked regularly new questions (not the golden questions) to the tool on various tables & topics, the metric being simply here the rate of correct answers on answerable questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final difficulty, linked to the high error sensitivity of text-2-sql, was its initial instability during development.\\r\\nTo remedy this, two minimum solutions quickly became apparent.\\r\\n1.\\tAny new change must be accompanied by a drift measurement (loss of reliability on questions that have already been mastered).\\r\\n2.\\tBy adding tables, new prompt elements can be confused with older ones, which were not designed at the same time. To counter this, a table assignment mechanism upstream of the chain should enable the LLM to be directed towards a list of candidate tables.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 6.\\tFuture Outlook\\r\\nThe landscape of talk-to-data solutions continues to evolve rapidly, with major players like Databricks and Google introducing interesting offerings. The Bird SQL benchmark continues to fill up with new records, and LLMs have greatly improved their code generation, thanks in particular to the \u2018test time compute\u2019 approach.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut our experience shows that all these use cases will require the following fundamental elements: excellent data governance, a solid business sense on the part of the players responsible for maintaining text-to-SQL-based products, and well-parametrized tools to ensure robust responses - expertise and solutions that we\'ve developed and proven to be consistently valuable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe future of text-to-SQL applications depends not just on technological advancement, but on the thoughtful integration of these fundamental elements.\\r\\n\\r\\n</div>"},{"id":"LLMs_fail","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/LLMs_fail","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-25-LLMs_fail.md","title":"Where LLMs still fail","description":"An exploration of current limitations in Large Language Models (LLM) through concrete examples, revealing their surprising struggles with seemingly simple tasks.","date":"2024-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 25, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Generative AI","permalink":"/blog/tags/generative-ai"},{"label":"LLM","permalink":"/blog/tags/llm"},{"label":"NLP","permalink":"/blog/tags/nlp"}],"readingTime":9.075,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jean LELONG","title":"Senior Data Scientist","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeanlelong/","imageURL":"/img/authors/jean_lelong.jpg","key":"jean.lelong"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"LLMs_fail","title":"Where LLMs still fail","authors":["jean.lelong"],"header_image_url":"img/blog/LLMs_fail_header.png","image":"img/blog/LLMs_fail_header.png","tags":["Generative AI","LLM","NLP"],"draft":false,"description":"An exploration of current limitations in Large Language Models (LLM) through concrete examples, revealing their surprising struggles with seemingly simple tasks.","keywords":["Generative AI","LLM","NLP","Innovation","Data Science","Large Language Models (LLM)","LLM limitations","ChatGPT","o1","o1-preview","Artificial Intelligence","Misguided attention","Next-token prediction","Natural Language Processing","Language model biases","Generative AI limitations","LLM errors","Machine learning challenges","Deep learning weaknesses","GPT limitations","Natural language processing issues","Chain-of-thought prompting","Ekimetrics AI","OpenAI","LLM tokenization","AI numeric processing","Language model reasoning"]},"prevItem":{"title":"How We Created Our First Talk-to-Data (Text-to-SQL) Application in Production","permalink":"/blog/Talk_to_Data_App"},"nextItem":{"title":"Optimizing Chatbot Performance: A Two-Phase Methodology for Enhanced Performance in HR Policy Responses","permalink":"/blog/Wombat_HR"}},"content":"\x3c!-- import useBaseUrl from \\"@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\\";\\n\\n<link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"{useBaseUrl(\'katex/katex.min.css\')}\\" />\\n --\x3e\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\n\\nThe field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has experienced an unprecedented explosion in recent years, and at the heart of this revolution are Large Language Models (LLMs). These powerful tools have transformed our understanding of what machines can achieve, rivalling human cognition in many areas. In just a few short years, LLMs have evolved from generating pseudo-coherent text in English (GPT-2; 2019) to enormous models that possess knowledge besting most human experts in specific domains (o1, claude 3.5; 2024).\\n\\nAt Ekimetrics, we\'re thrilled to be working with clients to harness the potential of these new technologies, exploring exciting applications such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), KPI extraction, or social media content generation. We use LLMs to manage and format knowledge in all its forms.\\n\\nOur team has witnessed first-hand the incredible capabilities of LLMs, and we\'re eager to continue pushing the boundaries of what\'s possible. However, despite their impressive abilities, even the best LLMs are still not without weaknesses.\\n \\nIn this article, we\'ll delve into concrete examples of LLMs struggling with seemingly trivial tasks and attempt to understand the underlying reasons for these failures. By exploring the limitations of LLMs, we hope to gain a deeper appreciation for their capabilities and develop strategies to overcome their weaknesses, ultimately unlocking their full potential.\\n\\nThe observations and insights shared in this article are purely my personal perspective, drawn from extensive experience working with Large Language Models (LLMs) in both research and production environments. As someone deeply immersed in this field at Ekimetrics, I recognize that LLMs are fundamentally complex \\"black box\\" systems. The examples and analysis that follow represent my professional observations and interpretations, but they are not definitive scientific conclusions.\\n\\nAll the examples below are generated using the latest version of ChatGPT available as of October 21, 2024. I chose ChatGPT because it is the most widely used and well-known access to an LLMs for most people, and it hosts state-of-the-art models from OpenAI. All messages you see are the first answers I got from ChatGPT, there are no previous messages, and no system prompt.\\n\\nAs a bonus, see o1 answers at the end of the article. It only get 1 out of the 3 examples right.\\n\\n\\n## Misguided Attention\\n\\nIn the realm of large language models (LLMs), one intriguing phenomenon that often leads to errors is what we could refer to as [misguided attention](https://github.com/cpldcpu/MisguidedAttention). This occurs when a LLM encounters a problem or prompt that closely resembles a well-known scenario it has encountered during its training. The model, recognizing the familiar pattern, may prematurely jump to conclusions without fully processing the nuances of the current situation. This is akin to a human cognitive bias known as the [Einstellung effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstellung_effect), where prior experience with similar problems causes individuals to apply previously learned solutions inappropriately.\\n\\nA classic example of this is the \\"Dead Schr\xf6dinger\'s cat\\" scenario. In this twist on [the famous thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger\'s_cat), a dead cat is placed into a box alongside a nuclear isotope, a vial of poison, and a radiation detector. If the detector picks up radiation, it releases the poison. The question is: \\"What is the probability of the cat being alive when the box is opened a day later?\\"\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/LLMs_fail/Schrodinger_cat.jpg)\\n</div>\\n\\n\\nNow watch what happens if we ask ChatGPT this simple question:\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/LLMs_fail/Chat_GPT_question.jpg)\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nAlmost all LLMs, upon encountering this problem, default to their learned response from Schr\xf6dinger\'s original paradox, which involves a living cat in a superposition of states. They fail to consider the critical twist\u2014that the cat starts out dead. This oversight occurs because the model\'s attention latches onto the familiar elements of the problem and neglects to process the new information. Some kind of \\"Oh! I already know this one!\\" effect.\\n\\nThis phenomenon is intricately tied to the way these models are trained. LLMs are trained on massive datasets comprising diverse text inputs from the internet, books, articles, and other sources. During this training process, the models learn to identify patterns, structures, and associations within the data. They use these patterns to generate predictions about the next token in a sequence, based on the context provided by preceding tokens. This ability to predict and generate text is largely driven by statistical correlations rather than true understanding or reasoning.\\n\\nAs a result, LLMs develop a keen sense for recognizing familiar patterns and scenarios that resemble those they have encountered during training. This can lead them to quickly latch onto well-known narratives or problem templates, even when subtle differences or new information require a different approach. The reliance on pattern recognition means that when a LLM encounters a prompt that closely mirrors a familiar scenario, it may default to the response it has learned for that scenario, without noticing new elements in the context. Even when new elements can be as critical as in this example. This is akin to how humans sometimes rely on heuristics or mental shortcuts based on past experiences, potentially leading to errors in judgment when faced with novel situations. Understanding this aspect of LLM training helps illuminate why misguided attention occurs and underscores the importance of developing strategies to mitigate its effects.\\n\\nThe challenge of misguided attention highlights both the potential and the pitfalls of LLMs. While their power lies in pattern recognition, enabling them to draw from vast reserves of knowledge, this same reliance can sometimes become their worst enemy when they encounter novel twists on familiar themes. By understanding these limitations and refining how we use LLMs, we can continue to enhance their reasoning capabilities, all the while mitigating risks such as hallucinations for our clients, thus unlocking even more sophisticated applications in natural language processing.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n## Following instructions\\n\\nLLMs are fundamentally constrained by their next-token prediction mechanism, generating text one token at a time without the ability to revise previous output. Unlike humans, who can reflect on and adjust their thoughts during writing, LLMs are locked into a linear, sequential process. This limitation can lead to inconsistencies or unintended outputs, especially when handling specific formatting requirements.\\n\\nIn the next example, I ask the model to write sentences that end with a particular word.\\n \\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/LLMs_fail/Ask_sentence.jpg)\\n</div>\\n\\nTo give you an idea of how bad LLMs are at this task, I couldn\u2019t even use one to reflect on the error, because they do not see any problem and consider the task completed with success.\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/LLMs_fail/Grade_task.jpg)\\n</div>\\n\\nWe can only try to guess why LLMs fail so spectacularly at this task. Here is my guess. While writing the sentence, the LLMs can only predict the next token. They \u201cknow\u201d they must include \u201chouses\u201d in the sentence but the sense of writing nice sentences seems to overtake their will to respect the user instructions. Often the sentence could have ended after the token \u201chouses\u201d, as if the model had planned to stop, but it can\u2019t help but adding a few more words for the sentence to sound nice. When using ChatGPT through the API, we can observe this behavior but cannot directly modify the model\'s output process. However, if we were to work with a local model where we have more control, we could potentially address this by forcing the model to stop at the desired word by manually inserting end-of-sentence tokens like \\".\\\\n\\" immediately after the target word. We could also investigate on the learned probabilities to select the next tokens in those situations, to estimate the willingness of the model to follow instructions over writing nice sentences.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n## Numbers\\n\\nLLMs perceive language as a sequence of tokens, rather than words and numbers. This tokenization process can lead to difficulties when processing numbers or proper nouns, as the model struggles to understand the context and relationships between these entities. For instance, when faced with mathematical equations, LLMs may falter, as they\'re forced to rely on statistical patterns rather than true comprehension of the operations to make.\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/LLMs_fail/Numbers.jpg)\\n</div>\\n\\nThe numerical comparison error in the image illustrates an interesting limitation of LLMs. In this instance, the model incorrectly concludes that 3.11 is greater than 3.9. The reason for this error may lie in how software version numbers are typically formatted - for example, Python releases follow a sequence like 2.0, 2.1, ..., 2.9, 2.10. Since the model has frequently encountered version numbers where 3.9 precedes 3.11, and commonly sees phrases like \\"version 3.9 or higher\\" (which includes 3.10 and 3.11), this pattern may have influenced its numerical reasoning. The model has thus learned this relationship between these numbers but struggles to discern that context matters and that by default the number 3.9 remains larger than the number 3.11. This also helps explain why it seems confused in its explanation \\"since 90 is bigger than 11, 3.9 is smaller than 3.11\\". It\'s almost like the model \\"knows\\" his first take was wrong but is too afraid to look bad by correcting itself.\\n\\nThis example is perfect to explain why chain-of-thoughts -before answering- are crucial for LLMs. Asking the model to explain its reasoning after it already gave its answer is just glorified post-hoc rationalization. However, prompting the model to write a justification before its answer can help it navigate the complexity of the task more effectively, leading to a more accurate final response.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\nDespite their remarkable achievements, LLMs continue to exhibit vulnerabilities in seemingly simple tasks. Through our exploration of misguided attention, next-token prediction limitations, and tokenization challenges, we\'ve seen how these powerful models can still stumble in unexpected ways. These limitations remind us that LLMs process language very differently from humans. Understanding these shortcomings is crucial not just for academic interest, but for practical applications in business settings. At Ekimetrics, this knowledge helps us design more robust solutions by anticipating potential pitfalls and implementing appropriate guardrails, such as chain-of-thought prompting. As the field continues to evolve, with models like OpenAI\'s o1 showing promising improvements, we remain both optimistic about the future potential of LLMs and mindful of their current limitations. This balanced perspective is essential for anyone working to harness these powerful tools effectively.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n## Bonus: o1 answers\\n\\n[o1](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/) is the latest model by OpenAI and n\xb01 LLM on most -and especially logical- benchmarks.

One might think this state-of-the-art model, made to think, reflect, and perform complex tasks, would ace those examples. This is also what I thought, before testing the model on those same prompts.

At Ekimetrics, we\'ve tackled this challenge head-on by developing a cutting-edge chatbot system designed to navigate the complex landscape of HR policies. Our approach leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and employs a rigorous two-phase optimization process. In this post, we\'ll walk you through our methodology, sharing insights that can be applied to enhance chatbot performance across various domains.\\n\\n\\n# Our Solution: A Two-Phase Optimization Approach\\n\\nHR policies form the backbone of any organization, guiding everything from leave policies to workplace conduct. However, the sheer volume and complexity of these policies can make it challenging for employees to quickly find the information they need. Our goal was to create a chatbot that could provide accurate, context-aware responses to HR queries, effectively serving as a 24/7 HR assistant. To achieve this, we developed a sophisticated optimization methodology divided into two distinct phases: enhancing source retrieval and fine-tuning answer generation. Let\'s dive into each phase, illustrated by our custom-designed infographics.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n## Phase 1: Optimizing Source Retrieval\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Wombat_HR/Source_Retrieval.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nThe first phase of our methodology was dedicated to optimizing the retrieval of relevant documents that the chatbot uses to generate answers. \\n\\nThis phase is crucial as the quality of the final answer is directly influenced by the relevance of the retrieved sources.\\n\\nAs shown in the \\"Sources Retrieval Pipeline\\" infographic, our process involves several key steps:\\n1.\\t**Document Processing**: \\n  - Parsing PDF documents into raw content\\n  - Cleaning and slicing the content using GPT-4\\n  - Embedding the document chunks with OpenAI ADA\\n  - Indexing the embeddings in a vector database\\n2.\\t**Query Processing**: \\n  - Reformulating the user\'s question using GPT-4\\n  - Retrieving relevant sources from the vector database\\n  - Incorporating conversation history for context\\n\\nKey parameters we targeted for optimization included:\\n- **k**: The number of documents retrieved in response to a query\\n- **min_similarity**: The minimum similarity threshold required for a source document to be considered relevant\\n\\nProcess: We began by defining the parameters k and min_similarity, which directly impacted the chatbot\u2019s ability to fetch the most relevant sources from the HR policy knowledge base. To optimize these parameters, we employed Optuna, a powerful hyperparameter optimization framework. The objective was to fine-tune k and min_similarity to maximize the relevance of retrieved documents, thereby setting a solid foundation for the subsequent answer generation phase.\\n\\nHere is the code snippet that demonstrates the optimization process:\\n</div>\\n\\n```\\nimport mlflow\\nimport optuna\\nimport gc\\n\\ndef objective(trial):\\n  with mlflow.start_run(nested=True):\\n    gc.collect()\\n    k = trial.suggest_int(\\"k\\", 1, 4)\\n    min_similarity = trial.suggest_float(\\"min_similarity\\", 0, 0.04)\\n    chunk_size = trial.suggest_int(\'chunk_size\', 200, 2000)\\n    metrics = get_metrics(k, min_similarity, indexes_names_template=\'hr-dev-{chunk_size}\')\\n    mlflow.log_params({\\"k\\": k, \\"min_similarity\\": min_similarity, \\"chunk_size\\": chunk_size})\\n    log_metrics(metrics)\\n    gc.collect()\\n    return -1*metrics[\'f1_score\']\\n\\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_name=\\"tuned_wombat_chatbot\\"):\\n  study = optuna.create_study()\\n  study.optimize(objective, n_trials=200)\\n\\nbest_params = study.best_params\\nprint(f\\"best_params : {best_params} with final f_score of : {-1* study.best_value} on trial {study.best_trial}\\")\\n```\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nTo create a realistic testbed, we engaged our Head of HR to formulate answers to 30 representative questions that the chatbot might encounter. These questions then served as our benchmark to systematically evaluate different configurations of k and min_similarity. By iterating through various combinations, we identified the optimal settings that resulted in the highest precision and recall rates during the retrieval process.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n## Phase 2: Fine-tuning Answer Generation\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Wombat_HR/Answer_Generation.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">  \\n\\nThe second phase focused on refining the chatbot\'s ability to generate final answers that are not only accurate, but also contextually appropriate, based on the retrieved documents.\\n\\nKey components of this phase include:\\n1.\\t**Question Reformulation**: Using GPT-4 to enhance the original user question\\n2.\\t**Source Retrieval**: Fetching the most relevant documents based on the reformulated question\\n3.\\t**Answer Generation**: Combining retrieved sources, conversation history, and the enhanced question to generate a final answer using GPT-4\\n\\nKey focus areas for optimization included:\\n- **Temperature**: Controls the randomness of the language model\u2019s predictions\\n- **Prompts**: Customizable templates that guide the chatbot in generating responses\\n- **chunk_size**: Optimizing the size of text chunks processed by the system\\n\\nProcess: With the retrieval pipeline optimized, the next step was to fine-tune the parameters governing the language model\u2019s behavior during answer generation. We adjusted the temperature parameter to balance creativity with accuracy, ensuring that the chatbot\'s responses remained relevant without deviating from the core content of the HR policies.\\n\\nIn addition to temperature, we experimented with different prompts that directed the chatbot on how to structure its responses.  This step involved crafting and testing various prompt versions to determine which formulations yielded the most accurate and contextually aligned answers.\\n\\nSimilar to the retrieval optimization, we used the same set of 30 HR-related questions and answers for evaluation.  By comparing the chatbot\'s generated answers against the expected outcome, we employed a bespoke similarity metric to identify the most effective parameter configurations. These similarity metrics were computed by an external model called an LLM Judge that assessed the semantic similarity between the chatbot\'s responses and the expected answers.\\n\\n\\n# Answer Similarity Assessment\\n\\nThis involved using a custom prompt to assess the semantic similarity between the chatbot\'s responses and the expected answers. By scoring this similarity and providing justifications, we gained additional insights into the chatbot\'s ability to produce responses that align closely with the intended content.\\n\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Here is the prompt that we used for the similarity assessment!</summary>\\n\\n  **Task**:\\n  \\n  You must return the following fields in your response in two lines, one below the other:  \\n  score: Your numerical score for the model\'s answer_similarity based on the rubric  \\n  justification: Your reasoning about the model\'s answer_similarity score\\n\\n  You are an impartial judge. You will be given an input that was sent to a machine learning model, and you will be given an output that the model produced. You may also be given additional information that was used by the model to generate the output.\\n\\n  Your task is to determine a numerical score called answer_similarity based on the input, output, and target.\\n  A definition of answer_similarity and a grading rubric are provided below.\\n  You must use the grading rubric to determine your score. You must also justify your score.\\n\\n  Examples could be included below for reference.

Scores can be assigned based on the gradual similarity in meaning and description to the provided targets, where a higher score indicates greater alignment between the provided output and provided targets.\\n\\n  **Grading rubric**:\\n  Answer similarity: Below are the details for different scores:\\n  - Score 1: The output has little to no semantic similarity to the provided targets.\\n  - Score 2: The output displays partial semantic similarity to the provided targets on some aspects.\\n  - Score 3: The output has moderate semantic similarity to the provided targets.\\n  - Score 4: The output aligns with the provided targets in most aspects and has substantial semantic similarity.\\n  - Score 5: The output closely aligns with the provided targets in all significant aspects.\\n\\n\\n  **Examples**:\\n\\n  Example Input:  \\n  What is MLflow?\\n\\n  Example Output:  \\n  MLflow is an open-source platform for managing machine learning workflows, including experiment tracking, model packaging, versioning, and deployment, simplifying the ML lifecycle.\\n\\n  Example Target:  \\n  MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning (ML) lifecycle. It was developed by Databricks, a company that specializes in big data and machine learning solutions. MLflow is designed to address the challenges that data scientists and machine learning engineers face when developing, training, and deploying machine learning models.\\n\\n  Example score: 4  \\n  Example justification: The definition effectively explains what MLflow is, its purpose, and its developer. It could be more concise for a 5-score.\\n\\n  You must return the following fields in your response in two lines, one below the other:\\n  score: Your numerical score for the model\'s answer_similarity based on the rubric  \\n  justification: Your reasoning about the model\'s answer_similarity score  \\n  Do not add additional new lines. Do not add any other fields.\\n\\n\\n  </details>\\n\\n  https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.metrics.html#mlflow.metrics.genai.answer_similarity\\n\\n  # Hyperparameter Optimization and Evaluation\\n\\n  Both phases utilized Optuna for hyperparameter optimization, with a focus on minimizing the negative F1 score for improving the retrieval quality, and minimizing the negative similarity score of the final answer relevance. Throughout the optimization process, all relevant metrics and parameters were logged using MLflow, ensuring comprehensive tracking and enabling systematic comparisons between different experimental runs.\\n\\n\\n# Potential Biases and Limitations\\n\\nThe obvious bias in the above process stems from the fact that the benchmark answers are written or vetted by a single individual, although this individual, as head of HR, has the final authority over what constitutes an acceptable answer. Nonetheless, any idiosyncrasies in how a single individual crafts sentences and structures answers are likely to have been picked up when computing similarity scores. Further, any development of chatbots for general usage will likely be optimized for sounding friendly and empathetic in a way that may transcend a single individual\u2019s writing style. \\n\\nFor instance, a user may expect interjections and exclamations such as \u201cCongratulations\u201d or \u201cCommiserations\u201d in output answers warranted by a given situation, which may deviate from sample answers that may be more factual. Our team had to balance such factors in their quest to achieve high similarity scores.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThe methodology outlined here presents a robust, two-phase approach to optimizing a chatbot system designed to navigate the complex and sensitive domain of HR policies. By systematically refining both the source retrieval process and the answer generation mechanism, we have developed a chatbot that is both precise and contextually aware. The integration of advanced hyperparameter optimization techniques, combined with rigorous evaluation and tracking through MLflow, underscores the scientific rigor of this approach. As a result, the chatbot is well-equipped to deliver high-quality, relevant answers, enhancing user experience and ensuring that critical HR-related queries are addressed with the utmost accuracy. Finally, this approach holds relevance for topics that transcend HR \u2013 the methodology is just as applicable to building RAGs in any area or domain.\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"Bayesian_NN","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Bayesian_NN","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-07-Bayesian_NN.md","title":"Bayesian Neural Networks","description":"Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) is a pioneering approach that embraces uncertainty as a strength.","date":"2024-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 7, 2024","tags":[{"label":"data science","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-science"},{"label":"deep learning","permalink":"/blog/tags/deep-learning"}],"readingTime":6.94,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"L\xe9opold Mendes-Charrinho","title":"Consultant","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/l%C3%A9opold-mendes-charrinho/","key":"leopold.mendes-charrinho"},{"name":"Nicolas CHESNEAU","title":"Domain Leader","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-chesneau-0416b94/","key":"nicolas.chesneau"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Bayesian_NN","title":"Bayesian Neural Networks","authors":["leopold.mendes-charrinho","nicolas.chesneau"],"header_image_url":"img/blog/bayesian_NN.jpg","image":"img/blog/bayesian_NN.jpg","tags":["data science","deep learning"],"draft":false,"description":"Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) is a pioneering approach that embraces uncertainty as a strength.","keywords":["data science","deep learning","bayesian"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Optimizing Chatbot Performance: A Two-Phase Methodology for Enhanced Performance in HR Policy Responses","permalink":"/blog/Wombat_HR"},"nextItem":{"title":"Multimodal Deep Learning","permalink":"/blog/Multimodal_fusion"}},"content":"\x3c!-- import useBaseUrl from \\"@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\\";\\n\\n<link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"{useBaseUrl(\'katex/katex.min.css\')}\\" />\\n --\x3e\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Bayesian_NN/bayesian_NN.jpg)\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) have revolutionized countless fields, from powering self-driving cars to aiding medical diagnoses. Yet, these marvels often lack a crucial human trait: the ability to say \\"I don\'t know.\\" While ANNs excel at making predictions, they struggle with uncertainty, confidently providing answers even when data is limited or unreliable. This can lead to misleading results, especially in critical areas where trust is paramount.\\n\\nEnter Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), a pioneering approach that embraces uncertainty as a strength. Inspired by Bayesian statistics, BNNs confidently acknowledge \\"I don\'t know\\" when the data gets hazy. This seemingly simple addition unlocks a treasure trove of benefits:\\n\\n- **Confidence, not certainty**: BNNs don\'t just predict, they provide confidence intervals, allowing users to understand the level of trust they can place in each answer. This leads to more informed decision-making, especially in critical situations.\\n- **Real-world robustness**: Built to handle the noise and outliers inherent in real-world data, BNNs are more reliable in uncertain environments, offering more trustworthy results.\\n- **Active learning**: BNNs can pinpoint their areas of highest uncertainty, actively seeking out the most informative data points to refine their knowledge. This continuous learning loop makes them even more powerful.\\n\\nThis fascinating world of BNNs holds immense potential, not just for improving traditional AI applications, but for building trust and transparency in a future increasingly reliant on artificial intelligence. As we delve deeper into their inner workings, explore their diverse applications, and discuss the exciting challenges and opportunities they present, be prepared to witness how \\"I don\'t know\\" becomes the secret weapon of the future\'s AI.\\n\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n# Neural Networks Essentials\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nIn order to understand the way bayesian neural networks, we will have to dive into what bayesian neural networks are based on : artificial neural networks.\\n\\nArtificial neural networks are part of the Artificial Intelligence that aims at replicating the way human brain works, this field is also commonly called \u201cDeep Learning\u201d.\\n\\nAn artificial neural network can be used for 2 main tasks :\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![screenshot-app ](img/Bayesian_NN/Regression.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n1.\\tClassification: task where the network learns to map input data to discrete categories or classes. This is achieved through the training process, where the network adjusts its weights and biases to minimize the difference between predicted class probabilities and the actual class labels in the training data.\\n\\n2.\\tRegression: task where the network is trained to predict a continuous output variable based on input data. In regression tasks, the network learns to capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, allowing it to make predictions on new, unseen data points. The training process involves minimizing the difference between predicted and actual continuous values.\\n\\n\\nAn artificial neural network will work this following way :\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![screenshot-app ](img/Bayesian_NN/Artificial_NN.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nThe artificial neural network (ANNs) can be considered as a mathematical function where you put in input the features which will be useful to predict an output.\\n\\nANNs are made up of interconnected nodes, called neurons, which process information and transmit it to other neurons. The neurons are arranged in layers, with each layer performing a different function.\\n\\nWe can split layers into 3 categories :\\n\\n1. Input layer is the first layer, it will receive the input data . The input layer neurons then process the data and transmit it to the hidden layers.\\n2. The hidden layers are the layers of an ANN that are not directly connected to the input or output layers. The hidden layers are responsible for learning complex patterns in the data. The hidden layers are also responsible for making predictions about the data.\\n3. Output layer is the last layer, the one that predicts the desired output.\\n\\nNeurons (rounds in our schema) in ANNs work by:\\n\\n1. **Receiving input signals**: From other neurons.\\n2. **Multiplying input signals by weights**: The weights determine the influence of each input signal on the neuron\'s output signal.\\n3. **Adding the weighted inputs**: To produce a sum.\\n4. **Passing the sum to an activation function**: Which produces the neuron\'s output signal.\\n\\nANNs are trained by adjusting the weights of the neurons. The goal of the training process is to minimize the error between the predicted output of the ANN and the actual output of the ANN.\\n\\nOnce the ANN is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data. The new data can be anything from images and sounds to text and sensor readings. The ANN will then produce an output for the new data.\\n\\nNow that we have a basic understanding of artificial neural networks (ANNs), let\'s discuss Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). BNNs are a type of ANN that uses Bayesian probability theory to represent uncertainty in the model\'s parameters. This allows BNNs to learn more robust models and make more accurate predictions, especially when dealing with limited or noisy data.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n# Bayesian Neural Networks : \\"I know that I know nothing\\"\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![screenshot-app ](img/Bayesian_NN/Standard_vs_Bayesian.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nBayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) have emerged as a powerful solution to address a fundamental limitation of traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): the ability to express uncertainty.\\n\\nWhile ANNs are proficient at making predictions, they often lack the capability to quantify uncertainty or admit when they don\'t have enough information. BNNs, on the other hand, introduce a Bayesian framework that inherently accounts for uncertainty in the model parameters.\\n\\nIndeed, one key difference between ANNs and BNNs is that ANNs learn a single point estimate of the model\'s parameters, while BNNs learn a probability distribution over the model\'s parameters.\\n\\nBy treating weights as probability distributions rather than fixed values, BNNs can express a range of possibilities for each weight, allowing them to convey a degree of uncertainty in their predictions. This inherent probabilistic nature makes BNNs more flexible and generic in handling situations where an ANN might simply provide a confident but potentially misguided answer. BNNs excel in scenarios where acknowledging uncertainty is crucial, providing a more nuanced and cautious approach compared to the deterministic nature of traditional ANNs. In essence, BNNs offer a valuable advancement by enabling neural networks to say, \\"I don\'t know,\\" thereby enhancing their applicability in real-world scenarios that demand a nuanced understanding of uncertainty.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nIn conclusion, while Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) present exciting possibilities in the realm of artificial intelligence, addressing challenges such as computational complexity and the need for efficient training algorithms is imperative for unlocking their full potential. The computational efficiency of BNNs, often demanding more resources than traditional ANNs, necessitates advancements in both hardware and algorithms to make them practical for real-world applications. Ongoing research focused on developing scalable training algorithms for BNNs is a key endeavor, with the promise of making these networks more accessible across various domains. Additionally, the interpretability of BNN outputs, despite their transparency in uncertainty quantification, requires further exploration to enhance widespread acceptance.\\n\\nOn the flip side, exploring the applications of BNNs reveals their transformative impact across diverse fields. In medical diagnoses, BNNs offer transparency and caution, providing not only accurate predictions but also confidence intervals that empower healthcare professionals to make informed decisions. In the financial sector, BNNs excel at predicting market trends, offering confidence intervals that assist investors and analysts in navigating the inherently uncertain landscape. The cautious approach of BNNs is particularly valuable in the realm of autonomous vehicles, where real-time quantification of uncertainty enhances safety in unpredictable environments. Furthermore, BNNs play a crucial role in robotics, allowing robots equipped with these networks to navigate complex environments with sophistication, adapting to unforeseen obstacles and uncertainties in ways traditional neural networks cannot.\\n\\nAs we navigate the evolving landscape of AI, Bayesian neural networks emerge as a beacon of progress, not just in making better predictions but in fostering trust, transparency, and adaptability. By embracing the notion of \\"I don\'t know,\\" BNNs illuminate a path toward collaborative interactions between AI systems and humans, providing nuanced and cautious insights in the face of uncertainty. The ongoing research and development in this field underscore the pivotal role that Bayesian neural networks are poised to play in shaping the next generation of intelligent systems.\\n\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"Multimodal_fusion","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Multimodal_fusion","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-29-Multimodal_fusion copy.md","title":"Multimodal Deep Learning","description":"Understand why multimodal deep learning models are more accurate than assembled unimodal models.","date":"2024-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 29, 2024","tags":[{"label":"data science","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-science"},{"label":"deep learning","permalink":"/blog/tags/deep-learning"},{"label":"multimodal","permalink":"/blog/tags/multimodal"}],"readingTime":8.34,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Fran\xe7ois GUERILLON","title":"Multimodal Specialist","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/fguerillon/","imageURL":"/img/authors/francois_guerillon.jpg","key":"francois.guerillon"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Multimodal_fusion","title":"Multimodal Deep Learning","authors":["francois.guerillon"],"header_image_url":"img/blog/multimodal_fusion.jpg","image":"img/blog/multimodal_fusion.jpg","tags":["data science","deep learning","multimodal"],"draft":false,"description":"Understand why multimodal deep learning models are more accurate than assembled unimodal models.","keywords":["data science","deep learning","multimodal","transfer learning","fine tuning","fusion encoder","dual encoder","natural language processing","computer vision","classification"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Bayesian Neural Networks","permalink":"/blog/Bayesian_NN"},"nextItem":{"title":"Uncertainty in time series forecasting","permalink":"/blog/Uncertainty_TS"}},"content":"\x3c!-- import useBaseUrl from \\"@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\\";\\n\\n<link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"{useBaseUrl(\'katex/katex.min.css\')}\\" />\\n --\x3e\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\n# Part 1: Why we use a fusion weapon\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Multimodal_fusion/Introduction.png)\\n</div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nData science (and specifically machine learning) is often seen as made up of different fields of expertise and research: \xab\u202fclassical\u202f\xbb machine learning (on tabular data), time series analysis & forecasting, computer vision, natural language processing\u2026 Indeed, each kind of (input or output) data, which we call **modality** \u2013 e.g. image, text, time series \u2013, has specific properties, raises specific challenges, and therefore requires dedicated solutions and evaluation methods.

Let us provide three examples: \\n\\n![screenshot-app ](img/Multimodal_fusion/Ad_Picture.png)\\n\\n- Product databases (manufacturing, retail, tourism, real estate\u2026) may contain tabular data, product descriptions or other textual information, product photos, time series for price or sales history\u2026 Each product has multimodal data. Each modality contains potential predictive information, for instance to forecast future demand or sales.\\n- Medical records include textual documents, tabular data, images, regular or irregular time series. Here again, for each patient, every modality may contain precious information to help diagnosis or prognosis.\\n- Advertisements, e-mails, newspaper covers and articles and social media posts are usually bimodal: texts combined with one or several images (and sometimes, texts within images). Both modalities surely have an influence on the impact (clicks, \u201clikes\u201d, sales\u2026) of these signals, and should be addressed when predicting this impact.\\n\\nThis is why, in our job as data scientists, we must design and implement the best solutions to harness combined data modalities.\\n\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n## A multimodal brain is better than several unimodal brains\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nEvery minute or even second, our human brain reacts, evaluates, and makes decisions after combining and processing several signals of different kinds, gathered from several senses. Each sense (or each modality) is correctly interpreted **thanks to the knowledge of all other signals**:\\n\\n- To know if the noise I heard on my right reveals a danger, I must concentrate my vision sense to the same direction (maybe turn my head) and look at the source of the noise.\\n- Imagine that someone shows me a document and gives oral explanations. Something sounds weird in these explanations. To know if my interlocutor is serious or joking, I must stop looking at the document, and look at his/her facial expression.\\n- To select what to pay attention to in this [famous awareness test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB_lTKZm1Ts), I must know and understand the written instructions (or game rule).\\n- As a specialist physician, to avoid missing weak signals in exam results (imagery, blood test history\u2026) and symptoms, I must understand why the patient was sent to me, which means reading the cover letter or medical report, so as to know what to focus on.\\n- In many bimodal documents, for instance scientifical articles, understanding the images (diagrams, charts) help understanding the text, and reading some texts (e.g. captions) can be necessary to understand the images or to deduce what is important to be watched in the image.\\n\\n\\nIf all these examples, suppose each modality is observed by a different person (a different unimodal brain), without any communication with the other persons, and afterwards, only afterwards, these persons can communicate and decide, without any access to the modalities. What will happen? They will probably miss something, because they did not look in the right direction, or did not focus enough on some detail, or misinterpreted a signal.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![screenshot-app ](img/Multimodal_fusion/Monkeys.png)\\n\\n\\nWhat if the neurons are artificial ones?\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n## Unimodal embeddings are not all you need\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nIn simple (or maybe naive) multimodal deep learning architectures, unimodal state-of-the-art (SoTA) neural networks work independently. Each unimodal brain classically produces a **unimodal embedding**, which is usually a vector (1D-array) or a sequence of vectors (2D-array) of numerical values, which is supposed to concentrate all useful information on the modality, in a reduced mathematical space. Then, a prediction is built from all these gathered embeddings, thanks to the addition of a few more trained neural layers (a \u201chead\u201d block), or with numerical machine learning solutions such as tree boosting. It looks SoTA, but it often induces poor performance.\\n\\nThe first reason is that each unimodal embedding is given in a different latent space: it means that it uses a language which is completely different from the other unimodal embeddings. Thus, the image embedding does not help guessing what is important to check in the text embedding, and vice versa. In the human scenario (unimodal brains), it would be as if the involved persons could not communicate correctly together: making a good decision would be quite unlikely.\\n\\nFortunately, public pre-trained models and architectures called **dual encoders**, like CLIP[^1] , can produce text embeddings and image embeddings in the same latent space (same language), which significantly helps bridging the gap between modalities, and improve predictive performance.\\n\\nBut this is not enough. You already know the second reason: even with dual encoders, each unimodal brain (network) does not communicate with the other brains when analyzing its modality, and therefore, does not focus enough on what is important in it. This is why a new family of multimodal models has been designed: **fusion encoders**. They allow, in each modality analysis, to progressively introduced useful information from other modalities. Thus, useful information is jointly extracted from all modalities of a same data sample.\\n\\nPretrained image & text (bimodal) fusion encoders, ingeniously assembling SoTA expertise of both computer vision and natural language processing, are now publicly available: ViLT[^2] , FLAVA[^3] , BLIP[^4] , BLIP-2[^5] \u2026 They can output **bimodal embeddings**, which contain rich relevant information from a pair {image, text}, analyzed together. They are excellent candidates for \u201ctransfer learning\u201d strategies: adding a trained \u201chead\u201d network on top of a fine-tuned fusion encoder, to make the desired prediction or forecast.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Multimodal_fusion/BLIP.png)\\n  \\n</div>\\n\\n## A demonstration by Ekimetrics\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nHuge product databases sometimes suffer from insufficient or irregular quality, due to historical or heterogeneous (sometimes manual) feeding processes. For instance, an irrelevant picture (product photo) may have been associated to an unmatching product. Manual thorough detection of errors, on millions of products, would be extremely costly. At Ekimetrics Innovation Lab (Eki.Lab), we have designed, built, evaluated, and validated a deep learning solution to efficiently semi-automate that task: it can detect most mismatches between an image and the known text fields (name, properties, description, summary\u2026) of the same product.\\n\\nOur most efficient solution mainly relies on a fine-tuned fusion encoder and trained head. Even with artificially generated hard-to-find image permutations (e.g. replacing an image with a similar but slightly different one) in test database, our solution can detect 87% (recall) of existing mismatches, with a tolerated precision of 50% (i.e. allowing that that only 1 suspicious image out of 2 is actually incorrect). On top of that, we have designed and validated a method to adapt the model to any unlabeled product database (self-supervision): costly human labelling is unnecessary.\\n\\nOur experiments confirm that without a fusion encoder, and even using CLIP as a dual encoder, results are much worse: recall remains under 30% with the same constraint on precision.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Multimodal_fusion/Fusion_encoder.png)\\n  \\n</div>\\n\\n## What about tabular data and time series?\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nNow, what would be the best solution for a predictive task in which multimodal input includes tabular data and/or time series? In most cases, there is no relevant pre-trained fusion encoder on these modalities, since there is no universal knowledge to deduce from pre-training on time series or tabular data. However, a few recent research papers, such as the Perceiver family (Perceiver[^6] , Perceiver IO[^7] , Hierarchical Perceiver[^8] ), show promising ways to build and train an accurate unique (fusion) deep learning model based on any combination of various modalities.\\n\\nCombining such a \u201cmultimodal-by-design\u201d architecture with pre-trained models (including fusion encoders) for both text and images, which may still bring useful knowledge with small-sized training datasets, is an active field of research[^9] , in which Ekimetrics is fully involved. A high range of disruptive use cases can be designed: in the near future, efficient multimodal models will help optimize media communication, forecast demand or sales to optimize product design or supply chain, forecast or optimize prices, help diagnosis or prognosis, perform impactful social media analysis\u2026 Please stay connected for future news on the subject!\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n[^1]: \xab Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision \xbb, A.

Time series forecasting involves analyzing historical data to make informed predictions about future trends, patterns, or values. However, due to various factors such as randomness, external influences, and incomplete information, forecasting models often encounter uncertainty. Managing and quantifying uncertainty in time series forecasting is crucial for decision-making processes across diverse domains such as finance, economics, weather forecasting, and supply chain management.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n## Why prefer uncertainty? \\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nAccuracy methods, otherwise known as point forecasting, are commonly used to address issues confronted in times series. Attempting to estimate the closest value to reality without considering all risk-related factors refers to accuracy. This approach leans more toward a retrospective examination of past errors. \\n\\nConsidering the stochastic nature of the universe, we aim to approach interval within which the true values will fall, considering potential future risks and potential future errors. We\'re no longer referring to point forecasting but rather interval forecasting.\\n\\nThe need to quantify uncertainty can arise in various ways, for example:\\n\\n\\n- Uncertainty forecasting helps energy companies make decisions about buying and selling energy in real-time markets, considering fluctuations in demand and supply\\n\\n- Forecasting uncertainty in demand and supply can help retail businesses optimize their production, distribution processes and stock management \\n\\n- Hospitals can use uncertainty forecasts to anticipate patient admissions, enabling better resource allocation, staffing decisions and pharmaceutical orders\\n\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Uncertainty_TS/EarthFromSpace.jpg)\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\n**The most important thing to keep in mind is that even a good estimator can make important errors due to the volatility that a time series can present.  To prevent this problem, the use of prediction intervals is recommended.**\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Popular methods for uncertainty quantification \\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nThere are a huge number of methods capable of creating prediction intervals that quantify the uncertainty surrounding an observation. However, it is possible to group most of them into five methods. \\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Bootstrap\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nBootstrap is a statistical technique used to estimate the variability of a statistic . It involves generating multiple bootstrap samples through resampling, with replacement, from  the original dataset. Subsequently, these samples undergo analysis employing the same statistical model.  The results provide a range of values that represent the uncertainty associated with your forecast or analysis, offering a more nuanced understanding of potential fluctuations in outcomes. This approach provides a flexible and data-driven method to assess the precision of statistical estimates.\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Uncertainty_TS/Bootstrap.png)\\n  </div>\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\nAdvantages of this approach include its utilization of non-parametric methods, requiring a minimal amount of data, and ease of implementation. However, the method has disadvantages such as demanding intensive computing resources, being highly dependent on input data, and posing challenges in terms of interpretation.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Asymmetric regression\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nIn machine learning, altering the loss function can reshape a model\'s predictions by influencing how it handles errors. During the training phase, a machine learning model learns to adjust its parameters to minimize the overall loss  , but in the case of asymmetric loss functions, penalties for overestimations and underestimations are different. The optimization process involves balancing the penalties associated with overestimating and underestimating based on parameter values. Fine-tuning these parameters allows to adapt the model\'s behavior. This introduces a nuanced response to errors. Among other things, this is the principle behind quantile regression.\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Uncertainty_TS/AssymetricRegression.png)\\n  </div>\\n\\nAdvantages of the approach include its compatibility with non-parametric methods . However, it comes with disadvantages such as the absence of mathematical guarantees, uncalibrated forecasts, and the complexity of interpretation associated with the method.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Probabilistic models\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nProbabilistic models are favored for their capacity to output distributions instead of single points estimates.  Numerous probabilistic models exist for time series forecasting, and among them, ARIMA models are notably popular.\\n\\nThe process begins with the model fitting the time series data, capturing the autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components, and ensuring stationarity through differencing (integrated component). After generating point forecasts, the model assesses the residuals, which represent the differences between the observed and predicted values. ARIMA utilizes the standard deviation of the normally distributed residuals to construct prediction intervals around the point forecasts. Essentially, the wider the prediction interval, the greater the uncertainty associated with the forecast. This technical methodology not only refines the accuracy of point forecasts but also provides a statistically sound measure of the range within which future observations are likely to fall.\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Uncertainty_TS/Probabilistic.png)\\n  </div>\\n\\nAdvantages of this method include its simplicity and interpretability, along with the absence of a requirement for exogenous variables (even if it could be also a disadvantage). However, the method comes with disadvantages such as reliance on assumptions about the data and the need for parameter selection like most probabilistic methods.\\n</div>\\n\\n### Bayesian approach\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nBayesian time series forecasting employs a technically advanced approach, involving probabilistic modeling, Bayesian inference, and iterative parameter estimation. During modeling, prior distributions are specified, which are updated through Bayesian inference with observed data to obtain posterior distributions. Techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo or variational inference optimize these distributions for parameter estimation. It allows you to quantify uncertainty in your forecasts thanks to posterior distributions.\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Uncertainty_TS/Bayesian.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n\\nAdvantages of this approach include the ability to incorporate business knowledge and the possibility of extracting insights despite weakly informative datasets. However, a notable disadvantage is that incorrect priors may lead to inaccurate results.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Conformal prediction\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nConformal prediction offers finite-sample conformal intervals applicable to any model and dataset without additional costs. It is particularly valuable for black box models, requiring no modification to their analysis or training. In addition to the usual testing and training datasets, the methodology also relies on a calibration set, which aids in generating conformalized intervals by rectifying errors introduced by the regressor. A crucial aspect in the design of conformal prediction is adaptivity. The objective is to ensure that the procedure yields larger intervals for more challenging inputs and smaller intervals for simpler inputs, tailoring the predictive uncertainty to the inherent difficulty of each input.\\n\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Uncertainty_TS/ConformalPrediction.png)\\n</div>\\n \\nAdvantages of this method encompass mathematical coverage guarantees, consistent and robust performance, and applicability to any model or dataset. However, there are drawbacks, such as certain methods requiring intensive computing, which may pose challenges in a business application context, and a dependency on a good regressor.\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n## Evaluation key points\\n\\n### Coverage\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nCoverage is a critical aspect in uncertainty prediction, particularly when considering an error level \u03b1 (0 < \u03b1 < 1). The anticipated outcome is that, for a given confidence level of (1 - \u03b1), we expect that (1 - \u03b1)% of the observations fall within the predicted uncertainty intervals. In other words, this statement underscores the importance of the model accurately capturing and quantifying uncertainty, ensuring that the specified percentage of observations is encompassed by the predicted uncertainty range, aligning with the desired level of confidence.\\n\\nThis concept becomes especially crucial in scenarios where robust and reliable uncertainty estimates are required.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Interval\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nIn uncertainty quantification, a brief interval is commonly seen as advantageous, suggesting improved precision in predictions with constrained uncertainty. While a narrow uncertainty interval signifies heightened confidence in the model\'s predictive capabilities, it is imperative to remain watchful of another critical factor: variance. Although low variance can indicate prediction stability, an excessively low variance may raise concerns. This could suggest that the model oversimplifies the complexity of the problem, potentially overlooking crucial nuances in the data.\\n\\nThus, achieving a balance between pursuing tight uncertainty intervals, indicative of precision, and considering variance is vital to ensure the resilience of the uncertainty quantification model, aligning it with the characteristics of the data.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Adaptiveness\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nAdaptability is a crucial aspect in evaluating uncertainty quantification, focusing on temporal and sectional adaptiveness. Temporal adaptiveness ensures that the model can dynamically adjust its uncertainty estimation over time, maintaining relevance amid evolving data trends. Similarly, sectional adaptiveness underscores the need for adaptability within different segments or subsets of a dataset. An adaptive model should effectively address variations in uncertainty within these sections, acknowledging potential diversity in conditions or characteristics.\\n\\nIn summary, within the realm of uncertainty quantification evaluation, adaptability, exemplified through temporal and sectional adaptiveness, represents a comprehensive and nuanced approach that return larger sets for harder inputs and smaller sets for easier inputs.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nIn conclusion, the exploration of time series forecasting underscores the shift from traditional accuracy methods to uncertainty quantification. Various methods, such as Bootstrap, Asymmetric Regression, Probabilistic Models, Bayesian Approach, and Conformal Prediction, offer diverse approaches, each with their respective advantages and disadvantages. Conformal prediction, a set of recent methods, still under research and development,  holds the potential to outperform other approaches in the field. That\'s why, at Eki.Lab, we\'re pushing ahead with many studies linked to Conformal Prediction.\\n\\nThe main points of evaluation  we need to look at when evaluating these methods are coverage and adaptivity. We want our predictions to be able to evolve over time and across different dimensions  of the dataset to ensure a good coverage rate whatever the particularities of the predicted observation. It\'s important to find a balance between keeping our uncertainty ranges narrow enough to be precise but also considering how much our predictions might vary. This is all the key to building a strong model that can handle the complexities of real-world data.\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"Economics_online_ad","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Economics_online_ad","source":"@site/blog/2023-09-01-Economics_online_ad.md","title":"Maths Men: The Economics of Online Advertising","description":"Willing to learn about the online ad market, cross-media effects and contextual advertising?

This PhD thesis was part of a 3-year academic partnership between Ekimetrics and Mines Paris PSL. \\n\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n## What is New with Online Advertising\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nAccounting for 67% of the 930 billion media spend worldwide[^1], online advertising is an obsessive presence in our online life. Search engines, video-sharing platforms, social media and now streaming services: ads are present in many formats on the Internet. In fact, most online platforms are partially or totally financed by advertising. Ad spending by brands subsidies online services, allowing platforms to charge no price to users. This is not new: classified ads financed free newspapers, just as brand sponsoring subsidized radio broadcast. So, what\u2019s new with online advertising? \\n\\n\\nEconomists pointed out that online advertising decreased the cost of targeting consumers[^2]. This is a major change in the marketing industry. While offline, advertisers can only target their ads toward a general context (newspaper title, TV show, billboard location), online ads can be addressed on a consumer-level basis using personal data (socio-demographics, web history, online behaviors). This decrease in targeting cost acted as a game-changer on many parts of the advertising industry:\\n\\n-\\t**Pricing and auctions**: finer targeting increases the quantity of ad impressions available to advertisers. As a result, such a massive volume of impressions cannot be sold at a flat price, just as in the offline advertising world. On the Internet, ad impressions are thus often allocated by auctions. Advertisers compete for a given ad impression based on the characteristics of the impression (user data, website\u2026). The brand associated with the higher bid then wins the impression and displays its ad. This allows ad spaces to be priced at their right price, making advertisers and publishers better off.\\n\\n-\\t**Intermediaries**: this complex system of auctions induces that brands and publishers should be able to manage their ad opportunities and bidding strategy on an impression-per-impression basis. Naturally, given the high volume of ad impressions traded every minute, this is not feasible. That is why, online, many ad intermediaries manage the trading of ad spaces on the supply-side (publishers) as well as on the demand-side (advertisers).\\n\\n-\\t**Data and Measurement**: the technical nature of online advertising emphasizes the power of data. Views, clicks, conversions: low-targeting costs allow advertisers to observe individual responses to their ads, producing a huge amount of data. Machine learning and data analysis are used at every stage of the ad-serving to optimize advertisers\u2019 bid, click-through-rate, publisher revenues, post-campaign attribution\u2026 \\nThat is why observers often made the claim that with the Internet, the advertising industry went from *Mad Men to Maths Men*.\\n\\nThis PhD thesis focuses on two questions: (i) how online advertising is distinct from traditional advertisement and (ii) how context plays a role in online ads effectiveness. These questions are answered using econometric techniques applied to advertising data.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n## Old World, New World?\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nThe first part of the thesis studies whether online advertising is a complement or a substitute to traditional advertisements (the one defined by offline mediums such as TV, radio, billboards, newspapers, or cinema). As we saw in the introduction, online advertising works in a very different way compared to offline media where ad buying involves human negotiation, discounts and where ad effectiveness cannot be observed directly. However, many economists claimed that offline and online advertising were close substitutes[^3]. \\n\\nOne can investigate this question according to two viewpoints: advertising supply and demand.\\n\\nOn the supply-side, we can determine that two types of advertising media are substitutes if brands tend to use both interchangeably. Conversely, two advertising media types are complements when advertisers tend to use them together, with the goal of generating synergies. Substitutability between two media types can be investigated using the concept of *cross-price elasticity*: when the price of a media type increases, how does it impact the demand for another media type? \\n\\nUsing data from 10 big national advertisers in three different industries, I investigate how firm\u2019s spending on offline, internet display[^4]  and search ads react to each media price. Using an econometric model derived from microeconomic theory, I find that offline and online advertising media types are not close substitutes.  \\nIntuitively, offline and search do not substitute for each other. Display and offline ad media types seem to be substitutes, but mostly for non-audiovisual media such as newspapers, magazines, and billboards. Indeed, internet display formats substitutes more easily to print advertisement than to TV or radio ads.  \\nFinally, the model shows that display and search ads are substitutable for advertisers. This can be natural as it seems certain types of display ads (such as retargeting) can be used to generate conversions, just as search ads.\\n\\nWe can also determine whether offline and online ads are complements or substitutes by looking at the demand side: i.e., how consumers respond to ads. Marketing researchers showed that advertising campaigns on different media may generate *synergies*[^5]. That is, the return of investing on two media may be greater than the sum of the two returns taken individually. This kind of synergy typically happens when branding and conversion media are played together. For example, a national TV campaign may raise awareness and desirability for a product, increasing online search volume and thus the effectiveness of sponsored links.\\n\\nIn another study of the thesis, I try to draw a line between offline ad spending and the effectiveness of search ads. Using data from a panel of brands in the hotel sector, I build an econometric model where clicks on sponsored search ads depend on the brand\u2019s own offline ad spending, other ad spending, seasonality, search ad exposure and market-specific factors. Because the effect of offline ad campaigns may be inter-temporal, the investments of period t-1 enters period t after being discounted by a factor *\u03bb*. I find that, on average, increasing the discounted stock of offline ad investments by 10% increases the volume of clicks recorded on search ads by more than 9%. Thus, the effectiveness of online ads also depends on the investment offline, making both types of media complementary.\\n\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Economics_online_ad/Picture1.png)\\n  <div align=\\"center\\"> Figure 1: Relationship between Clicks on Online Ads and Offline Advertising\\n  </div>\\n</div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nOverall, my results suggest that offline and online advertisements are not close substitutes. Looking at how both types of media work, the way advertisers use them and how consumers react to them, offline and internet advertising are different, and sometimes complementary, markets.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n## Context Matters!\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nThe ability to finely-target advertisements has allowed brands to better match their message to consumers. Targeted advertising thus generates gains by reducing ad \u2018waste\u2019[^6] (which occurs whenever the ad is distributed to a consumer who has no preference for the product advertised).\\n\\nHowever, focusing solely on individual targeting obliterates an important factor: context. In many cases, internet advertising as been subject to placement issues: an ad may be placed on an unviewable part of the page or worse, inside a bad context. The latter case includes ads displayed on controversial websites (e.g., conspiracy-related blogs, pornographic websites), or inside a content that is irrelevant to the ad: in 2012, an ad for cruise vacations run on a YouTube showing the sinking of the Costa Concordia[^7]. There are many other examples.\\n\\nThis kind of issue arises from an information asymmetry between the advertiser and the publisher. Online advertising features so many possible ad placements and the process of matching ads to placements is so complex that, eventually, advertisers rarely know where their ad appears. Without carefully considering contextual effects, advertisers may waste their ad budget, and even harm their brand image by appearing in bad contexts. Two works of my studies try to shed light on such contextual effects.\\n\\nIn a first study, I use data from a viewability provider to investigate the determinant of ad viewability. The data showed that more than 20% of video ads for a healthcare advertiser were never seen. I try to investigate the determinant of ad viewability. Using an econometric model, I show that when the ad network did not have incentives to make ads viewable, it reduced the overall viewability rate of the campaign. Buying ads on a cost-per-view instead of cost-per-impressions basis induces the ad network to make the ad viewable, increasing viewability by almost 20%. Programmatic advertising also deters ad viewability by introducing opacity between the advertiser and the publisher.\\n\\nIn a second study, I investigate how controversial content on socials impact advertising effectiveness. I use the 2020 Facebook Ad Boycott as a natural experiment. In July 2020, more than 1,000 advertisers pulled out their ad spending from Facebook and Instagram as both platforms were hosting controversial content. Using data from an advertiser in the skincare industry that continued to advertise, I estimate how Facebook ad effectiveness changed compared to the brand\u2019s ads on other platforms. Controlling for platform-specific effectiveness and seasonality, I find that during the boycott, Facebook Ads experienced a decrease of up to 10,000 clicks compared to the expected effectiveness of the ads.\\n\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Economics_online_ad/Picture2.png)\\n  <div align=\\"center\\"> Figure 2: Effect of the boycott (week 0) on clicks recorded on Facebook Ads. Estimates are reported with 95% confidence interval.\\n  </div>\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nOnline advertising is evolving at an unprecedent pace and so is regulation. Since 2020, political initiatives foster consumer protection, privacy, and abuse of dominance in the digital economy. This has at least two implications for online advertising.\\n\\nFirst, for antitrust purposes market regulators need to define the relevant market for advertising. Does regulation on the online ad market affect offline advertising? Does Google Ads compete with national TV networks? Such questions are crucial to understand the market power of online advertising players. This thesis brings some insight from this perspective.\\n\\nSecond, the strengthening of personal data regulation, along the end of third-party cookies will emphasize the importance of ad context. As targeting individual-level characteristics will be more and more difficult, brands will gain in leveraging context to target their ads. For example, targeting hotel ads on travel blog pages is a way to reach relevant consumers. \\n\\nFinally, cookies limitation will impact advertiser\u2019s ability to finally measure the return of their advertisement. More than never, holistic econometric measurement with Marketing Mix Modeling is a key tool to measure advertising effectiveness.\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n[^1]: eMarketer (2023).

The tool aims to democratize access to the scientific literature of climate change and biodiversity, making it easier for researchers, policymakers, and the public to understand and use this critically important information. This article aims to provide users with information regarding the tool, encompassing its contextual framework, technical operation, as well as its inherent limitations.\\n\\nDisclaimer : for simplicity, we use \u201cclimate\u201d as an umbrella term to designate the phenomena of climate change & biodiversity loss.

Introduction: Why ClimateQ&A\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nAgainst the backdrop of rising global temperatures and the alarming decline of biodiversity, human societies are not catching up on action. Across geographies, widespread climate literacy remains low, which limits and hinders actions to mitigate and adapt to these pressing challenges. This lack of actionable knowledge is due to several factors, including the increasing demand for climate-related information from all groups of society (including the public sector, students, corporates, policymakers, investors, and local communities, among many others), and rising fake news & climate skepticism. Another important issue is that scientific reports of IPCC and IPBES present some inherent limitations regarding accessibility, language, and understanding. Indeed, at a Side Event at COP21 in Paris, in the lead-up to the Oslo Expert Meeting on Communication in 2016, IPCC Chair Hoseung Lee asked :\\n\\n\\n> \u201c*What use are the IPCC reports if many of the intended users cannot understand them, do not know where to find them, or cannot use them in their work?\u201d*\\n\\n\\nIn this part we explore these issues, which are vital to inform the development of our tool ClimateQ&A.\\n\\n</div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n### A.\\tClimate knowledge and literacy are still lagging\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nIn order to act against climate change, citizens need to be climate-literate:\\n\\n> *\\"Climate literacy is a subset of the broader science literacy that refers to the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that individuals, communities, and societies need to understand and address climate change effectively. It draws on climate science, the quantitative and geospatial technologies by which it is understood, and the interconnectedness of human beings with their environment . Literacy on climate change is vital for informed decision-making, emissions reduction, and community resilience.\\"* [^1]\\n\\nDespite the importance of climate literacy, studies find that in advanced economies, ~70% of people are aware of climate change and its consequences, but only 20% are climate-literate[^2] [^3].\\nAdditionally, climate awareness is unequally distributed: in 2015, 40% of adults in the world had never heard of climate change \u2013 roughly 2Bn people. In some developing countries like Egypt, Bangladesh, or India, this represents more than 65% of the adult population[^4].\\n\\n</div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n### B.\\tThe demand for climate-related information is increasing\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nDriven by the global and far-reaching implications of climate change - across geographies, populations, sectors of activity, organizations- the demand for accurate, timely, and relevant climate information is increasing. Businesses and investors seek to understand their exposure to climate and biodiversity-related risks. Educators need to train a new generation of students, who will live with the consequences of climate change. Policymakers require reliable information for effective strategies. The media plays a vital role in disseminating factual information to the general public. As climate change shapes our world, this demand will continue to grow, requiring informed decision-making across sectors. \\n\\nAnother significant catalyst for information demand stems from the targeting of the IPCC by misinformation campaigns. The surge in media coverage surrounding climate change has witnessed a simultaneous surge in influential campaigns disseminating misinformation. These campaigns employ tactics such as selective media exposure, contrived controversies, alternative facts, and distorted media balance. Adding to this, social media algorithms amplify existing social circles and reinforce pre-existing opinions, while individuals increasingly rely on these platforms as their primary sources of information. Consequently, people find themselves trapped in echo chambers, unaware of the consensus or under the false impression that substantial uncertainty exists[^5]. Frequently, socio-economic narratives and a sense of loss resulting from climate change policies direct individuals toward disbelief and denial. These narratives create a clash between scientific communications on climate change and one\'s familiar ideas and way of life, often intertwined with automobiles, industry, consumption, and a carbon-centric economy. As climate skepticism is based on narratives that do not even revolve around climate itself[^6], climate science communications have often achieved limited success.\\n\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/ClimateQA/Picture1.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n\\nIn this context, it becomes paramount for climate scientists to multiply their communication endeavors and generate tailored content that caters to diverse audiences. By doing so, they would ensure that each segment of society has access to information that is relevant to their specific needs and concerns. This would enable users to not only access the desired information but also empower them to fact-check the information they come across. While the IPCC has made significant efforts to improve its communication strategy (e.g.; the organization held The Expert Meeting on Communication of 2016 which led to a number of recommendations to enhance IPCC communications activities, strategy and capacity), there are a number of limitations to this strategy stemming from how these organizations operate.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/ClimateQA/Screenshot_Twitter_ClimateQA.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n### C.\\tThe role of the IPCC and IPBES : practical limitations and consequences\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nIPCC and IPBES reports are the Gold Standard of the science of climate and nature, as they present a scientific consensus and synthetize in great detail, coverage, and historical depth the key considerations regarding living and countering with climate change, and the trends of biodiversity and nature\u2019s contribution to people. Despite the unquestionable thoroughness and quality of these assessments, challenges to their true adoption by policymakers and civil society persist. Some practical challenges include:\\n\\n- **Language.** One significant limitation is the language barrier. Due to their affiliation with the United Nations, the IPCC and IPBES reports are only available in the UN\'s official languages, namely Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian, Spanish, and English. While these languages are spoken by approximately four billion people as either a first or second language, which accounts for 50% of the global population, the remaining 50% are unable to access climate science information from official sources due to this language restriction.\\n\\n-\\t**Audience.** Another challenge lies in the intended audience of these reports. Originally designed to provide a comprehensive review and recommendations on the state of climate science, the main recipients of these reports are technical audiences, such as scientists and policymakers. The IPCC and IPBES produce various types of documents, including Summary for Policymakers (SPMs), Full Reports, and Technical Summaries. These reports are often lengthy, exceeding 15,000 pages for the main IPCC and IPBES reports, and are filled with specialized terminology, such as confidence levels and uncertainty. Additionally, these reports are accessible only in PDF format through the respective organizations\' websites.\\n\\nThe level of complexity of this publications is such that at the 5th Assessment Report, senior policymakers called for a \u201cSummary for Citizens\u201d to complement the Summary for Policymakers[^7].\\n\\n\\nMoreover, as the organizations\' mandates emphasize neutrality and a \\"policy-relevant\\" but not \\"policy-prescriptive\\" approach, their ability to communicate and engage with stakeholders is limited. They are constrained from publishing any information that has not undergone rigorous multilateral validation or that lacks contextualization. With the general purpose of bridging climate and nature science to policymaking, both organizations are built on three emergent principles: holding the line between policy relevance and prescription, enlisting geographically diverse participants, and evolving a thicket of procedures to guard scientific credibility[^8]. The first principle aims to provide policy-relevant information without prescribing specific policies[^9], thus upholding neutrality and respecting the mandates of multilateral environmental agreements[^10]. In an official statement, the IPCC declares :\\n\\n*\u201cBy endorsing the IPCC reports, governments acknowledge the authority of their specific content. The work of the organization is therefore policy-relevant and yet policy-neutral, never policy-prescriptive[^11].\u201d*\\n\\nWhat this means, is that in order to publish approved, adopted, and accepted reports, these organizations avoid technocratically mandating a particular policy solution when a range of options are feasible (even to different degrees)[^12]. While this neutrality reinforces the credibility that is derived from their strict processes, it gives rise to two major improvement areas:\\n\\n1. **The need to consider reports collectively**[^13].  To avoid missing important information, it is essential to consider the entire body of reports collectively. The IPCC reports undergo a formal review process involving multiple drafts. Comments and feedback are provided by scientific experts, as well as representatives from governments and appointed consultants. These comments are taken into account during the approval of the Summary for Policymakers (SPM) and acceptance of the full report. Given that SPMs are subject to a high degree of compression, each sentence requires approval from the parties involved (scientists and government representatives), which often leads to rigorous discussions[^14]. While this dialogue-based approach strengthens the IPCC assessment, it is important to make other relevant documents accessible to interested audiences.\\n\\n2.\\t**That scientific knowledge must be accessible to non-technical audiences**. Building upon the previous point, the strict rules governing report texts restrict their modification. The IPCC faces challenges in presenting reports to non-specialists in a language that is more accessible, avoiding jargon such as confidence levels and likelihood language[^15], as well as reducing their length. While the IPCC may face criticism for delivering messages in a clearer, shorter, and potentially less rigorous manner, collaboration with other stakeholders can help bridge this gap.\\n\\n</div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n## II. Implications for the tool : desired features & outcomes\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nStemming from 1. The need for increased climate-related information in a relevant and fast manner and 2. The practical limitations stemming from IPCC and IPBES operating principles, we derive some features to inform the product development of ClimateQ&A. The tool must be, and provide answers that are: \\n\\n- **Truthful**: Our tool aims to present climate change and biodiversity information as accurately as it is documented in scientific reports. It serves as a reliable resource for fact-checking fake news, and its content can be easily fact-checked with the original sources. It should also follow the structure of IPCC reports, from SPMs to Full Reports.\\n- **Clear**: With a focus on catering to diverse audiences, our tool avoids technical jargon and provides concise answers that are easily understandable by both technical and non-technical users. It ensures that complex concepts, such as uncertainty and confidence levels, are explained in a user-friendly manner.\\n- **Comprehensive**: The tool compiles information from a wide range of available reports, supplementing individual report findings with additional sources and relevant discoveries. This comprehensive approach ensures that users gain a holistic understanding of the subject matter.\\n- **Accessible**: Our tool is designed to be freely accessible to all users, transcending language barriers by providing multilingual support. It is optimized for compatibility across various devices, allowing users to access the tool seamlessly.\\n- **Fast & Intuitive**: By utilizing advanced search functionalities, our tool enables users to navigate through reports swiftly, eliminating the need for cumbersome manual searches (e.g., Ctrl + F). It automatically identifies and retrieves relevant words and topics related to the user\'s query, streamlining the information retrieval process.\\n- **Collaborative**: The development of our tool is a collaborative effort that incorporates feedback and input from stakeholders across different domains, including non-technical users, technical experts, and scientists. This collaborative approach ensures that the tool meets the needs and expectations of a diverse user base.\\n\\nWe have designed the technical core of the tool to fit the aforementioned specifications.\\n\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n## III. Technical core\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nClimateQ&A is built of several technical algorithmic modules, ChatGPT being the last one (the generation of an answer). The core of Climate Q&A consists of three steps, summarized in Figure 1: creation of a structured dataset, question enrichment and sourcing, and generation & display in an interface.\\n\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/ClimateQA/Picture2.svg)\\n</div>\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Figure 1: Climate Q&A global architecture. First, a structure dataset is created from a set of heterogeneous documents in an offline mode (1.Structured dataset creation). \\nThen, user questions  are enriched and sources (step 2). Finally, the answers with its sources are displayed in a web application.\\n</div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nAll the documents used for Climate Q&A are listed in the application page (section Sources) : https://huggingface.co/spaces/Ekimetrics/climate-question-answering \\n\\n<ins> Step 1: Creation of a structured dataset from a set of heterogeneous documents</ins>\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\nThe first step parses a heterogeneous set of documents (PDFs, Words etc) and extracts information, which is stored in a structured database.\\n\\nThe algorithm uses OCR techniques for all the documents stored in any given folder. The document structure is preserved, meaning that paragraphs are linked to section titles, figures are linked to the passages that cite them, etc. A structured database is thus created, containing all the information extracted from the documents and the relationships between the different entries in the database. These entries are then represented as a vector of finite dimension. In ClimateGPT, we use SentenceBert, but any type of representation is possible. This will serve as the basis for a quick search in the database for step 3.\\n\\n<ins>Step 2: Enrichment of the user\'s LLM query</ins>\\n\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\nIn the second step, the user\'s query is reformulated and enriched by searching for similar passages in the structured database. The relevant question and passages are encapsulated in a prompt, which also serves to limit the scope of acceptable answers for ClimateQ&A.\\n\\nWithin the step of enriching the user\'s query, the goal is to create a query on an LLM from the question, whose answer will be formulated from the documents of interest (the structured database from step 1). First, the user\'s question is reformulated in a more intelligible way for a LLM by asking the model to do it. Then, the new question is compared to all entries in the database using the Faiss algorithm developed by Facebook, known for its execution speed on data corpora up to billions of entries. The most relevant entries, meaning those with the most significant similarity to the question, are selected, filtered by a thematic classification model (in this case, does the entry discuss climate?) and encapsulated in a prompt, necessary for querying an LLM (in our case, GPT-3.5 Turbo). The prompt contains other information, such as not going beyond the scope of its knowledge and formulating its answer based on the selected entries. The prompt created is then used to query an LLM.\\n\\n<ins>Step 3: Displaying the results : generative part</ins>\\n\\nThe query result (i.e.; the question) is displayed on an interface. The answer is generated using the 10 most relevant references found in the corpus of documents. The sources are displayed alongside the answer, so that the user can verify the information and extract it for a report if necessary.\\nThe display is based on two parts: the LLM\'s answer with the notes serving as a reference, as well as the sources used to formulate the answer. For ClimateQ&A, we use the OpenAI Azure environment to send the request and get the response. Just like the ClimateQ&A interface, the user can continue their search by asking several questions in a row like a real ChatBot.\\n\\n<ins>Comments and future work</ins>\\n\\nWe use GPT-3.5 Turbo for Climate Q&A, but our methodology can be applied to any type of LLM. We have chosen this tool for the generative part of our model because it has been exceptionally optimized for dialogue using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) \u2013 a method that uses human demonstrations and preference comparisons to guide the model towards desired behaviors. In the future we will test other models like Bard and Llama.\\n\\nThe hierarchy of the documents are not taken into account in the first version. Summary reports can be used in a first time to a concise answer. If the user wants more details, global and longer reports can then served as references to add additional facts, numbers to the answer. Looking for passages or references in the most recent documents could also make our approach more relevant. This feature will be added in the next version of Climate Q&A. \\n\\nQdrant is an excellent alternative to FAISS algorithm for search similarity, as it allows natively metadata featuring ( e.g. : search for a specific set of documents, or creating filters on passages), whereas FAISS can not. Moreover, Qdrant is faster for a small amount of data and is easier to use and maintain in production. We will add Qdrant as an option of similarity search for our next version.\\n\\nThe interface of the first version of Climate Q&A displays textual information only. In the future, we will integrate images and graphics to enrich the answer. Building a specific graph for the answer would also be a notable improvement. For example, a graph which shows the evolution of the carbon footprint for a country per year is of a great interest to the question : \u201cDid the carbon footprint of France increase the last five years?\u201d \\n\\nTextual data is now the main source of references for Climate Q&A, but a lot of information is contained in tabs or graphics (like checked numbers etc). One of the main improvements for Climate Q&A is to better parse and retrieve information from graphics and tabs. It will include novels features in OCR techniques and information retrieval techniques. \\n\\n</div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n## IV.\\tAlgorithm performance\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nIn order to assess the performance of our model, we evaluate the individual performances of each of the elements that form the generation of an answer.\\n<ins>Retrieval</ins>: evaluating the retrieval process specifically on our data is a difficult task without a custom labialized dataset. Our approach to quantitatively evaluate it was to sample a thousand paragraphs from our knowledge base, and for each ask a LLM to generate a question that could be answered with each paragraph. Then, we did the inverse process and tried retrieving the documents using the questions. For the model we currently use, the paragraph was in the top 10 documents retrieved in 3 cases out of 4. There are lots of biases to this method and we are still working to refine it, but the results allow us to test and compare performance for different retrieval models.\\n\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\n\\n<ins>Generation</ins>: answers provided by ClimateQ&A are subject to a human evaluation whose evaluation criteria are outlined below.\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\n\\nWe analyse the performance of our model by comparing the answers of ChatGPT and ClimateQ&A to those provided by the IPCC, assumed to be a \u201cground of truth\u201d. We evaluate the answers based on the below criteria, i.e. relevance, accuracy and completeness, structure, quoting, and consistency. These serve as a qualitative measure of performance for the algorithm.\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/ClimateQA/Picture3.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n## V.\\tLimitations\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nClimateQ&A has been built to answer to climate and biodiversity-related questions by finding 10 relevant paragraphs in the original IPCC and IPBES documents and generating an answer from those paragraphs. There are inherent limitations to this configuration and the underlying assets and tools that we use to parse the documents, retrieve relevant sources, and generate answers. In this part, we elaborate on these limitations, which we are planning to address in the following versions of the tool. These limitations are related to the content of the answers, biases inherent to the configuration of the model and the generative module, and the environmental footprint of AI.\\n\\n**Limitations regarding the answers** : ClimateQ&A performs well in questions that are somewhat specific and whose answers can be found in the reports.\\n- ClimateQ&A does not work well when it comes to summarizing entire documents. For example, a question such as \u201cWhat are the conclusions of the last IPCC report on climate mitigation?\u201d will not yield a high quality answer. The questions need to be more precise and concise in order for the retriever to find relevant passages and produce a better answer.\\n- ClimateQ&A cannot directly answer questions whose answers cannot be found in the reports, but that are relevant to understand and fight against global warming in specific contexts, for example \u201cWhat is the IPCC\u2019s position on the use of megadams as a solution to climate change?\u201d, \u201cWhich French political party has the strongest measures against climate change?\u201d, etc. These questions might not be answered precisely and could even be blocked by our moderation feature.\\n- For other limitations of GPT-3 models regarding text synthesis and structural & algorithmic limitations, please refer to (Brown, et al. 2020). \\n\\n**Bias**: there are some bias associated to how the model is built and the underlying assets.\\n\\n<ins>Bias from the generation of answers linked to ChatGPT</ins>: GPT-3 was trained on a massive dataset of text from the open internet, including the entire public internet toughly every month since its inception (60% of weight in training mix, also called CommonCrawl), a crowd-sourced curated selection of the internet most popular page referrals from Reddit and Social Media (with a weight of 22%, also called the WebText2 dataset), portions of books that are available online (16%), and Wikipedia in English (3%).\\n\\n Though sources are diverse, the biases of the data that the model has been trained on are retained. Biases favor language & culture (predominantly English and Western-centric) and men. Conversely, negative sentiments are recorded for black people and Islam in GPT-3[^16]. These biases represent an important aspect to assess the broader societal impacts of tools like ClimateQ&A, especially as those biases translate in prejudices and views about climate change, which are, as seen in Part 1, very context-specific. In general, we find that the Anglo-Saxon single-materiality approach, i.e. to consider climate change risks that might have a financial impact on businesses (and not also the impacts of businesses on climate change), might produce some biases in our model. ChatGPT has also been finetuned via human feedback and user feedback. These might represent additional biases to the model.\\n\\n<br/>\\n<ins>Bias in structure and selection</ins> :  The developers of ClimateQ&A are European data scientists, engineers and climate / biodiversity consultants. There may be some biases related to the background of these persons, as well as the fact that none are climate or biodiversity scientists. While we have received feedback from expert scientists, most users that have given feedback are non-technical regarding climate change. These might influence how the model is built and the answers that are generated.\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\n<ins>Positive bias in the questions that are asked to the algorithm</ins>: we have introduced a positive bias in the questions asked to the model by providing a reformulation feature that softens the contents of the answers. For example, questions that read \u201cShould we eat the rich?\u201d were reformulated as \u201cWhat are the most effective ways to reduce the carbon footprint of the wealthiest people in society?\u201d.\\n<br/> \\n<br/> \\n\\n**Limitations regarding the environmental impact of AI**: training and using large AI models requires substantial amounts of resources. The progress driving large models has been achieved through increasingly large and computationally-intensive deep learning models and in general, improving accuracy of models is at the expense of economic, environmental, and social costs[^17]. In order to evaluate the environmental impact of our model, we need indicators that measure the environmental impact of each module (given that we don\u2019t train the model ourselves), and that can be aggregated for total. As the environmental impacts of AI depend on the local energy infrastructure, hardware used, running time, and the number of parameters, there are still few measures available to perform this task and inform users.\\n\\n\\n<ins>Carbon footprint</ins>: \\n\\nto estimate the carbon footprint of our model, we use CodeCarbon, a Python package that estimates the power consumption of hardware (GPU, CPU and RAM) and applies the carbon intensity of the region where the computing is done[^18]. We estimate the following emissions for each phase of the project at Ekimetrics.\\n<br/>\\n<br/> \\n\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/ClimateQA/Picture4.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n*Link for [The carbon footprint of ChatGPT](https://medium.com/@chrispointon/the-carbon-footprint-of-chatgpt-e1bc14e4cc2a)\\n\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\nCarbon Emissions are **relatively low but not negligible** compared to other usages: one question asked to ClimateQ&A is around 0.482gCO2e - equivalent to 2.2m by car and 1ml of water[^19].\\nIn this calculation we do not include the carbon footprint of training ChatGPT (done by OpenAI) that has been estimated to 1,287MWh, corresponding to 552 tons of CO2 equivalent, which is similar to 1.2M liters of water and 2.5M km by car, 63x the Earth\u2019s circumference.

We also work on GCP and Cloud Dataflow, where Apache Beam provides the same flexibility to process streams as well as batches.\\n\\nBut IT teams ans Business teams are so used to batch analytics that it is hard to convey the value of real-time or up-to-date analytics, even though we now have platforms to handle the sources that can stream data. And with the emergence of micro-services, we also have more and more of these sources.\\n\\nBased on current market evolutions and on our previsions:\\n\\n- **Companies should create real-time views** of customers, products, suppliers and production plans on an easy-to-grow platform with the adequate governance,\\n- **Companies should assemble a real-time analytical view of their whole business** to be able to steer it appropriately,\\n\\nBecause this article is about real-time analytics, it starts with the definition of these terms. We use the example of driving a car as parallel for running a company. We all drive cars, we all see cars change, for example from \u201cmanual gearbox\u201d to \u201cautomatic gearbox\u201d to \u201cno more gearbox\u201d, and we all have a lot of knowledge about cars. Car technology will be used in this article to illustrate the following questions:\\n\\n- What is the minimal data available to drive a car and what is the benefit of additional data ?\\n- How to transpose for example the ABS of a car into a platform to help drive a company ?\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\nBelow are the steps in this article, as they will be presented and explained: \\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/level_car_analytics/Global_Table_1.png )\\n  \\n</div>\\n\\n<br/>\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Definitions\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nLet\u2019s first introduce definitions of the two topics of this article (independent of the car illustration):\\n\\n**Analytics**, as separated from **Operational**, is related to **data**:\\n\\n- **Operational data** is internal data from the business operations,\\n- **Analytical data** is operational data that is aligned, consolidated, reprocessed and possibly augmented with external data.\\n\\n <br/>\\n\\n**Real-time**, as separated from **Batch**, is related to **processing**:\\n\\n- **Batch processing** is about processing data on a schedule, between every few hours and every month. Users gets an image that is always a bit old, but for many businesses and operations this is seen as acceptable,\\n\\n- **Real-time processing** is about reflecting the current status of the operations. The latency depends of the source rather than the processing, it is between a few seconds and a few hours depending on the capability of the source system.\\n\\nWhen analyzing a business process, it is always a very interesting exercise to diagnose if a certain metric is operational or analytic. And if the data is analytic, the next question is to wonder if the business could benefit from having that metric in real-time.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n## Car-wise, let\u2019s start in the 1950s\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nI work in Paris, and tourists love to tour the city in Citro\xebn 2CV, a French car that was produced between the 50s and the 80s, like the picture below from one of the numerous companies renting these cars.\\n\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/level_car_analytics/Block_figures_1.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo electronics in there, this is pure mechanics and a few electrical wires, an ideal starting point for our journey !\\n\\nWhat data do you have to drive a Citro\xebn 2CV? Speed, battery level, gas levels, total mileage, that\u2019s it.\\nAnd the engine is so noisy that there is no need for an engine RPM meter !\\n\\nAccording to the definitions above, the data is the direct readings of the mechanical operations of the car, for example from the speed of the wheels, so this is operational data.\\n\\nNo further processing here, so no analytical data at all.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\nFinally, let\u2019s introduce this diagram of the car with no Analytics at all:\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/level_car_analytics/Diagram_1.png)\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n### How does driving a 2CV transpose to driving a company?\\n\\nWhen we transpose to driving a company, operational data is the data that resides in the operational systems, such a CRMs and ERPs. It contains all the referential and transactional information necessary to run the company, from HR to Sales to Finance. All reports and dashboards that are directly embedded in these applications or close to them are also considered operational data.\\n\\nSince there is enough information to run the business, we can jump to our first conclusion:\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/level_car_analytics/Diagram_2.png)\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n## Born in the 80s and mandatory in EU in 2003, the ABS\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nThe ABS, or Anti-lock Braking System, measures the speed of each wheel and reduces the pressure on the brakes to avoid the wheel locking up when losing grip.\\n\\nTo brake efficiently, it applies \u201cthreshold braking\u201d and \u201ccadence braking\u201d that are techniques of the most skillful drivers, taken here at a much faster rate than what these drivers can perform.\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/level_car_analytics/Diagram_3.png)\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n### What is real-time analytical processing of operational data in a business?\\n\\nIf we change the wheels of the cars by the BUs of a company, we get to a functional diagrams like the one below, where each BU includes efficient controls applied in real-time on the data from the operations:\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/level_car_analytics/Diagram_4.png)\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\nData Science is applied locally on the operational data, for purposes like segmentation, scoring, pricing and other applications of Machine Learning. The purpose here is to get value from investments in each BU, **but there are no insights to make the whole bigger than the sum of its parts.** It is like in the example of the ABS, we want to replicate the techniques of the best players, locally in each domain.\\n\\nIt is important to note that local AI initiatives do not require a dedicated platform for analytical data and that improving the operations locally can be achieved in the operational applications. For example, SAP and Salesforce include more and more predictive features. And since these platform work on up-to-date information, **embedding Machine Learning in operational systems is the closest to what ABS is in a car.**\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n## In 2014, the ESP becomes mandatory in all European cars\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nThe ESP (Electronic Stability Program) is an anti-skid system. It leverages four wheel-speed sensors, the steering angle sensor and an inertial measurement unit to act on the break pressure of each wheel and engine acceleration command. Depending on the situation, it can reduce the speed of the engine and brake all wheels or activate the brake on only one wheel only to alter the heading of the car.\\n\\nThe diagram changes, since all insights are now consolidated before they are processed:\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/level_car_analytics/Diagram_5.png)\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n### What does an ESP looks like in a company?\\n\\nIn your company, we are leaving the territory of ERPs, because even SAP does not cover all aspects that must be monitored and given sense together.  \\nIn addition, ERPs have many limitations regarding Advanced Analytics:\\n\\n- ERPs are complex to query and it may impact production,\\n- ERPs don\u2019t need and don\u2019t keep history,\\n- ERPs don\u2019t care about weak signals and don\u2019t make sense of unstructured data,\\n- ERPs are not designed to consolidate data with other ERPs or other operational platforms,\\n- And lastly, when a change is interesting, it takes ages to impact ERPs.\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\nBecause consolidation cannot occur in the operational systems, **we introduce an additional data storage and processing layer called the analytical data plane** . We assemble data platforms that can host data assets of different Business Units, with some local autonomy and some global governance, so insights can be derived from many elements. This is where the Lakehouse and the Federated Governance patterns apply. \\n\\nThis is also where we believe we must now work in real-time, like in the ESP in the car analogy. The driving force is that **the analytical plane should be up-to-date with the data that is shared from the operational systems**, it should not add an hourly or a daily delay between the times it processes data.\\n\\nMost use-cases that we currently in batch will benefit from being executed with up-to-date data from the operations. Let\u2019s take a two examples:\\n\\n- The purpose of a Customer 360\xb0 use-case is to consolidate Transaction history, Social media presence, Customer support interactions, Segmentation history, Sensitivity to the promotions and prices, etc. into a single view of the customers. \\n\\n  Having that information always up-to-date could let you, for example:\\n  * Target, or restrain from targeting, in certain situations,\\n  * Send messages at the right moment,\\n  * Propose Next Best Action when the customer calls,\\n  * etc.\\n\\n- Expanding on that up-to-date Customer 360 and adding up-to-date supply-chain information and up-to-date suppliers information will enable new use-cases to better serve the customers needs.\\n\\n\\nIn addition to use cases, and if we consider a company as a complex system, **it is important to monitor all its moving parts together to better understand its reactions.** And when there are days or weeks between an action and the monitoring of its effect, it is more difficult to steer.\\n\\nFor these reasons, we want to propose real-time as the new standard, today: \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/level_car_analytics/Diagram_6.png)\\n\\n<br/>\\n</div>\\n\\n## Mandatory in 2022, AEB is the current state-of-the-art\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nIn addition to sensors that focus on the inside of the car, AEB (Automatic Emergency Braking) uses sensors that look outside of the car, like Front radar sensor, multi-purpose dashboard camera(s) and corner radar sensors. All these components embark object detection and tracking with deep neural networks and share their insights to a central unit that can act on the car brakes. \\n\\nThis is the most complex system that we study here and we can anticipate that the next step will be cars exchanging information together about conditions of the road. In the projects we currently participate in on connected cars, no data is currently shared between cars.\\n\\n\\nSo our last diagram is the most complete:\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/level_car_analytics/Diagram_7.png)\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n### Do you have AEB-like system in your company?\\n\\nAEB is about adding data sources to better anticipate market conditions, to better understand your customers, to better interact with your suppliers and your distributors, to gather data about your competitors, etc.\\n\\nAnd by now you have understood that in the context of the AEB, the purpose is to consolidate these insights in real-time and leverage these to take the best decisions.\\n\\nWhile buying or trading data is good, sharing data on platforms like Snowflake, BigQuery or Databricks Delta Sharing is better, because it is maintained in real-time by the other parties and you don\u2019t have to replicate it in batches.\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/level_car_analytics/Diagram_8.png)\\n\\n<br/>\\n</div>\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nWhile the focus of this article has been on the value of up-to-date analytics, we\u2019ll close this article with a preview of a next topic : the costs of the streaming datasets compared to traditional batch approaches.\\n\\nEkimetrics is investing a lot in making sure we manage the environmental aspects of the solutions we build, so this last point is critical! We currently work with Spark streams that have the .trigger(availableNow=True) option so they only process the newly arrived rows when the pipelines are executed every hour for example.  \\nSo that it remains cost- and emission- efficient.\\n\\n \\nAnd as a closing remark, as I was looking for the dashboards of the Renault 4L, Peugeot 205 and other 2CV, I found that in the latest small car from Citro\xebn, called the AMI, it is nearly as frugal as its predecessors ! \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/level_car_analytics/Block_figures_2.png)\\n\\nAnd it weighs only 500kg, which is frugal too.\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"/2023/02/28/building_datalake_part_2","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/02/28/building_datalake_part_2","source":"@site/blog/2023-02-28-building_datalake_part_2.md","title":"Building a datalake - Part 2 - Smart storage & computing strategies for better usability and usefulness","description":"For this second part of datalake building, we\u2019ll go deeper into the journey of data, more specifically expand on storage and compute strategies.","date":"2023-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 28, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Datalake","permalink":"/blog/tags/datalake"},{"label":"Data Engineering","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-engineering"},{"label":"Architecture","permalink":"/blog/tags/architecture"},{"label":"Data Governance","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-governance"},{"label":"Data Mesh","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-mesh"}],"readingTime":8.445,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Emilien BOUCAUD","title":"Data Engineering & Architecture Consultant","url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Building a datalake - Part 2 - Smart storage & computing strategies for better usability and usefulness","author":"Emilien BOUCAUD","author_title":"Data Engineering & Architecture Consultant","author_url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com","header_image_url":"img/blog/overview_datalake_part_2_v2.png","image":"img/blog/overview_datalake_part_2_v2.png","tags":["Datalake","Data Engineering","Architecture","Data Governance","Data Mesh"],"draft":false,"description":"For this second part of datalake building, we\u2019ll go deeper into the journey of data, more specifically expand on storage and compute strategies.","keywords":["Data Science","EkiLab","Ekimetrics","Eki.Lab","Eki","Machine Learning","Artificial Intelligence","Data Science for business","Datalake","Data Engineering","Lakehouse","Data Architecture","Data Governance","Data Validation","Data Mesh","Azure","AWS","GCP"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Does your company level with your car in terms of Analytics?","permalink":"/blog/2023/03/07/level_car_analytics"},"nextItem":{"title":"Exploring the links between creative execution and marketing effectiveness - Part V: Key Paths to Success and Common Pitfalls to Avoid","permalink":"/blog/2023/02/21/creative_execution_and_marketing_effectiveness_part_V"}},"content":"\x3c!-- import useBaseUrl from \\"@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\\";\\n\\n<link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"{useBaseUrl(\'katex/katex.min.css\')}\\" />\\n --\x3e\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/datalake_part_2/overview_datalake_part_2_v2.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n## Article Scope\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nIn a previous article - [Building a datalake - Part 1 - Usable, Useful, Used, or how to avoid dataswamp and empty shell traps | Eki.Lab](https://ekimetrics.github.io/blog/2022/02/07/building_datalake_part_1/) - we took a look at the foundation architecture used at Ekimetrics when building a datalake. Its focus was to present design elements to ensure your datalake is useful and usable at its core, as well as best practices to avoid falling into the so-called data swamp and empty shell traps.\\n\\nFor this second part, we\u2019ll go deeper into the journey of data, more specifically expand on storage and compute strategies, and see how the organisation of data and the way it is transformed impact a datalake\u2019s usability & usefuleness.\\n</div>\\n\\n## Introduction\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nThe overview of data\u2019s journey through a datalake or data platform can be broken down into five steps, represented below from left to right.\\n\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/datalake_part_2/img1_data_journey.png)\\n\\n  <div align=\\"center\\"> Data\u2019s journey, from source to usage\\n  </div>\\n  <br/>\\n\\nA data platform is highly versatile in providing technical options the five steps above. Getting your data from one step to the next means applying a strategy for how the data input is stored, how it is processed and how the output is exposed for the next step.\\n\\nThese strategies will vary depending on the use case and platform, taking business as well as technical constraints in consideration. Designing your datalake\u2019s strategies to be versatile and homogeneous is essential. It allows your data platform to grow fast, in terms of data content as well as use case possibilities. It also ensures that the datalake is under control with a common way of treating data, where its only varying specifities are the entry point (data sources) and output (serving layer). \\n\\nAt Ekimetrics, we\u2019ve developed versatile strategies that are applicable to most common use cases, easily reproducible. These strategies help build new capabilities and provide a better understanding of your data platform.\\n</div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n## Where designing storage & compute strategies really matters\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nIn most datalake architectures, the data journey\u2019s step where the most impactful design decisions can be made is _Data storage and processing_. The other steps are more straightforward:\\n\\n- Data sources are usually out of the architect or data engineer\u2019s control, as they often sit outside of the data platform (e.g. on a third-party server).\\n- Ingestion is a step for which design questions around data validation & organization processes may be worth considering. We\u2019ve talked about these processes in the first part of our \u201cBuilding a datalake\u201d articles. As for streaming vs batch, it is only dependent on the source: if the source system is streaming data, a resource to ingest that is necessary ; otherwise, recurrent batch ingestion is the go-to.\\n- Serving will depend on the target use case, so even if there are important design decisions to make, they will only be impactful in the scope of their use case, not for the whole datalake.\\n- Usage will most of the time be outside the datalake and depend on the use case. The few design decisions that may be necessary here won\u2019t be as impactful to the datalake\u2019s usability and usefulness either.\\n\\nOf course, this is not to say that designing relevant strategies and architecture for these steps doesn\u2019t matter: they must be tailored to the business case and technical constraints.\\n\\nOn the flipside, the _Data storage and processing_ step is the central piece in the datalake puzzle. It is where storage and compute strategies will be the most impactful. \\n\\nWhat could it look like, then ? Inside this central step, data transits through four zones, from its raw form to fully processed for a particular use case, ready to serve to your businesses. These four zones are detailed below, in between ingestion and serving.\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/datalake_part_2/img2_data_storage.png)\\n\\n  <div align=\\"center\\"> Data storage and processing - storage zones\\n  </div>\\n  <br/>\\n\\nThese zones can be found under various names: Landing - Bronze - Silver - Gold, or Temp - Raw - Cleaned - Conformed, etc. The intent is the same, where data becomes more and more usable and business use case oriented with each zone.\\n\\nIn between each storage zone, organization and transformation processes are applied to organize and extract insights out of data. This is where our storage and computing strategies come in.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n### Going from source to raw: storage strategy\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nAn ingested source will usually be exposed in one of two possible ways: \\n\\n- Incremental changes, where only what is new or updated is exposed.\\n- Full datasets, where all of the up-to-date data (or a new timeframe of data) is exposed.\\n\\nIn these two cases, the ingestion strategy we recommend results in the same outcome. Here the strategy is to historize all received data, adding metadata about its reception date (or validity date) through organization in the storage architecture or in the dataset itself. The RAW storage zone becomes a source of historical knowledge about all data points and their changes through time. Doing this, we\u2019re also able to add a \u201cslowly changing dimension\u201d / \u201cchange data capture\u201d aspect to our data, where we can easily find a data point\u2019s values at any moment in time.\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/datalake_part_2/img3_computing_1.png)\\n\\n  <div align=\\"center\\"> Fig. 1: Computing & storage strategies in between Landing and Raw zones\\n  </div>\\n  <br/>\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nThere are limitations to historizing all received data, notably storage costs: this is where the data\u2019s lifecycle must be discussed. Keeping all older versions of a single dataset may start to become expensive as the data piles up, outweighing the pros if only the latest values are used.\\n\\nIn this case, a solution can be to keep only the latest values of the source\u2019s data points, or just one version of the source every N periods on top of the latest ones. We can then archive older and unused versions in cold, less costly storage resources. The archived data enters a different lifecycle, where it could be removed at some point in the future if it doesn\u2019t serve any business purpose.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nThe \u201chistorize everything\u201d strategy ensures RAW storage is the most useful it can be: use case agnostic, your businesses can use and explore the data at its full potential. It also helps unify the way RAW storage is meant to be read by your later processes, improving usability while allowing for costs optimization without sacrificing the underlying principle.\\n\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Going from raw input to refined output: computing strategy\\n<div align=\\"justify\\">\\n\\nBy applying this highly inclusive storage strategy for our RAW storage, we\u2019re then able to fetch the necessary data for our business cases, whether it\u2019s using the full history of a source, its latest version or the latest changes only.\\n\\nThe most common computing strategy will be to generate an up-to-date view of the data: at the time of computing, what are the insights\u2019 state ? We\u2019re also able to use older data to track changes and generate insights from these.\\n\\nRefined data can then be exposed in two ways, acting as the source for another system: \\n\\n- Exposing the full dataset, where all data is up-to-date\\n- Exposing incremental changes, where only what is new or updated is sent to the serving layer\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/datalake_part_2/img4_computing_2.png)\\n\\n  <div align=\\"center\\"> Fig. 2: computing and storage strategies in between Raw, Trusted and Refined zones\\n  </div>\\n  <br/>\\n\\nFor some use cases, you can generate \u201cfrozen in time\u201d views of the data, only updating the current timeframe\u2019s view. For instance, we could update the current month\u2019s exposed insights each day, then stop updating it at the end of the month, writing a new one for the next month\u2019s computed insights, and so on.\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nHistorizing our transformations and results is useful for debugging and business exploration, but iterations may start to pile up, so defining a lifecycle for Trusted (TRD) and Refined (RFD) storage is important as well: do our technical processes or business use cases need all the iterations history stored in trusted TRD ? Can our business use cases work with a simplification of RFD storage, similar to the Delta historization for RAW zone in figure 1 ? \\n\\n:::\\n\\nYou may have noticed, our exposed Refined storage looks strangely similar to what we had in the data source: we\u2019re exposing either the full up-to-date version of our insights, or just updates and new ones, just like our sources. The datalake is now a source for your business\u2019 use cases, so it makes sense that it would be able to expose data in a similar way.\\n\\nThe \u201cup-to-date view\u201d strategy is highly useful for most use cases, and through smart use of historization, still allows for your businesses to get insights on the data\u2019s evolution through time.

Object Detection (OD) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) were used to detect specific features in creative images, such as faces, smiles, text, brand logos, etc. Then, in combination with impressions data, marketing mix models were used to investigate what objects, or combinations of objects in creative images in marketing campaigns, drive higher ROIs.\\nIn this last part we share with the reader common pitfalls to avoid when utilising tools for Object Detection, Optical Character Recognition and MMM, as well as things to keep in mind, that will facilitate the process.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n## Common Pitfalls to Avoid\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\n- **Failing to Define Labels at the Start:** Define the set of labels that are going to be studied at the very beginning. Adding more labels in the middle of the study would involve having to go back to time consuming tasks, such as manual labelling and repeated extraction and processing of labels.\\n\\n- **Ambiguous Object Definitions:** Describe clearly from the start what each label is (e.g., \u201cPerson\u201d can be any body part, not just a whole body with a face). This is helpful when the manual labelling is being done as a team, rather than by one person. Furthermore, if using a pre-trained model, ensure that your definition of the object aligns with what is detected by the model. For example, you may define \u201cCar\u201d as just the outside of the car while the OD model is trained to detect both the interior and exterior of cars.\\n\\n- **Non-Generalizable Labels:** If you are studying two separate sub-brands within one brand, it is advisable to have two separate studies, rather than one. That is, instead of defining objects \u201cBrand A Logo\u201d and \u201cBrand B Logo\u201d, it may be better to separate the brands into different streams and have the same object labels for both (e.g., logo, brand cue, product and person). This will ensure that you code is reusable for studies of brands that have different numbers of sub-brands.\\n\\n- **Lazy Manual Labelling:** Make sure to manually label all objects in a creative. For example, if there are three cars, label all of them, not just one. The manually labelled validation set is the ground truth against which a model\u2019s performance is compared. If some objects are missed, you may have strange performance results that indicate that the model may be over-detecting objects.\\n\\n- **Trying to be Exhaustive:** Avoid testing all open-source resources available, as this can be very time-consuming and not very fruitful. Choose two or three to test and instead spend more time on what you can do to improve their performance on your particular dataset. This could, for example, be done through hyperparameter tuning (e.g., testing different learning rates, batch sizes, confidence thresholds, etc.) or in the processing of the results (e.g., correcting any text labels inside logos or products).\\n\\n- **Lack of Checkpoints:** Due to the many different data manipulation steps in this project, there are a lot of potential sources for errors. The key is to set up automatic checks at each stage to avoid a trickle down effect of avoidable errors. For example, removing false positives in face detection by only \u2018accepting\u2019 a detected face if a person was also detected in the creative will ensure that the feature time series that is used for MMM does not suddenly have more impressions for faces than for people. Similarly, when doing the feature engineering, employing a simple method of checking that there are no negative values, no missing data, and that the impressions and spend data is consistent across each sub-model will ensure that time is not wasted in the MMM stage from modelling with incorrect data. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n## Key Paths to Success\\nThere are various components that can contribute to successfully executing this type of study, ranging from technical requirements to general strategies. Some of the key components are outlined below. \\n\\n### Integrated, Efficient Tools\\nChoosing the right tools can make or break a project of this complexity. Choose a platform which offers robust functionalities to help streamline and facilitate work. This study used Azure, but GCP is another great alternative. The key features that are required are:\\n- **Cloud storage:** Due to the volume of creatives included in this study, cloud storage was crucial. Particularly if extracting frames from videos, it is important to account for the significant volume of additional images that need to be stored. This project used Azure Storage. \\n- **Labelling Software:** The labelling process is very manual and time-consuming. Having an intuitive software that can import creatives directly from the cloud storage saves a lot of time and effort and avoids unnecessary duplication of images. Furthermore, the software should be able to export the labels as a JSON file which can then later be converted to the required format (e.g., COCO for Detectron2). For this project, the Azure Machine Learning Studio Data Labelling functionality was used. \\n- **External Computation Resources:** As the training, validation and final labelling of images are all computationally expensive processes, the use of external computation resources (clusters) is recommended. The configuration of the clusters can vary depending on the task at hand. For pre-processing and feature engineering, individual CPU-enabled single-node clusters are sufficient. On the other hand, for the training, validation, and labelling processes, it is recommended to use GPU-enabled clusters. While GPUs are a more expensive resources than CPUs, the efficiency gains may make up for the additional cost per hour. For this project, Databricks was used as it can connect to Azure storage, facilitates the use of clusters, supports various programming languages, and allows for collaboration on Notebooks.\\n\\n\\n### Contextual Knowledge\\nHaving a strong understanding of the brand acts as a crucial foundation for every step of this project. It is not only required for making informed decisions regarding which objects should be detected but also vital for defining the features to be measured in the MMM. For example, knowing that products often appear in creatives alongside just a hand raises the question of whether this is the most effective use of a person, or if including the person\u2019s face would be more effective; this in turn leads to the creation of features testing products alongside \u2018face-less\u2019 people vs. people with faces. Contextual knowledge can also be gained throughout the project by stopping to analyse the data. For example, checking the distributions of manually labelled objects can give an early indication of performance of custom-trained models (feasibility for successful training and detection) as well as the expected impact for regression models.\\n\\n### Strong Base Models\\nHaving strong base models is also key for success in this project. Since the target variable of the sub-models is determined by the contribution of the Meta variables in the base model, a poor base model will directly impact the performance of the sub-model. The quality of the base model will largely depend on the dataset used, so ensuring that sufficient, relevant, and good quality data relating to the baseline, market variations, and marketing activity is crucial. \\n\\n### Programmatic Sub-Modelling\\nDepending on the number of feature groups, KPIs and sub-brands included in the study, it may be infeasible to run the sub-models on a one-by-one basis. For context, this project had 156 sub-models (13 base models x 12 feature groups). For that reason, it is recommended to create a methodology that allows for the programmatic creation of sub-models. \\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"/2023/01/15/creative_execution_and_marketing_effectiveness_part_IV","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/01/15/creative_execution_and_marketing_effectiveness_part_IV","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-15-creative_execution_and_marketing_effectiveness_part_IV.md","title":"Exploring the links between creative execution and marketing effectiveness - Part IV: MMM for Creative Marketing Effectiveness","description":"In this Part IV we explore the MMM methodology applied.","date":"2023-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 15, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Object Detection","permalink":"/blog/tags/object-detection"},{"label":"Optical Character Recognition","permalink":"/blog/tags/optical-character-recognition"},{"label":"Marketing Mix Modelling","permalink":"/blog/tags/marketing-mix-modelling"},{"label":"Deep Learning","permalink":"/blog/tags/deep-learning"},{"label":"Tesseract","permalink":"/blog/tags/tesseract"}],"readingTime":5.09,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Marina Bermejo Sarmiento, Monica Brondholt Sorensen, Karin Sasaki","title":"Data Scientist Consultant","url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Exploring the links between creative execution and marketing effectiveness - Part IV: MMM for Creative Marketing Effectiveness","author":"Marina Bermejo Sarmiento, Monica Brondholt Sorensen, Karin Sasaki","author_title":"Data Scientist Consultant","author_url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com","header_image_url":"./img/blog/Eki_Meta_part_IV.png","tags":["Object Detection","Optical Character Recognition","Marketing Mix Modelling","Deep Learning","Tesseract"],"draft":false,"description":"In this Part IV we explore the MMM methodology applied.","keywords":["Data Science","EkiLab","Ekimetrics","Eki.Lab","Eki","Machine Learning","Artificial Intelligence","Data Science for business","Operational Research","Optimization","Knapsack problem","Deep Reinforcement Learning"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Exploring the links between creative execution and marketing effectiveness - Part V: Key Paths to Success and Common Pitfalls to Avoid","permalink":"/blog/2023/02/21/creative_execution_and_marketing_effectiveness_part_V"},"nextItem":{"title":"Exploring the links between creative execution and marketing effectiveness - Part III: Tesseract Pre-Trained Optical Character Recognition Models","permalink":"/blog/2022/12/13/creative_execution_and_marketing_effectiveness_part_III"}},"content":"\x3c!-- import useBaseUrl from \\"@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\\";\\n\\n<link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"{useBaseUrl(\'katex/katex.min.css\')}\\" />\\n --\x3e\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/Eki_Meta/Eki_Meta_part_IV.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nThis article is **Part IV** of a set of five technical articles that accompany a [whitepaper](https://ekimetrics.com/news-and-events/exploring-the-links-between-creative-execution-and-marketing-effectiveness-exclusivepreview) written in collaboration between Meta and Ekimetrics.

Here you will learn that to improve accuracy in your measurement you must treat creatives differently. We provide the MMM methodlogy to reproduce this type of analysis for your brands.\\n \\n </div>\\n\\n\\n\\n## MMM Process\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nAn optimizsed two-staged modelling approach was applied to existing MMM models developed by Ekimetrics for a range of brands, products and KPIs. First, the base models were optimizsed, and second, sub-models were created to explain the variation in Meta contribution using the creative features. Bayesian optimization was used in both steps for variable transformation in relation to lag, adstock and saturation.\\n </div>\\n\\n <p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n ![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part4/1.png)\\n\\nModelling Workflow\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n## MMM Model\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nThe MMM models used in this analysis are multilinear regressions accounting for all significant factors driving the KPI (most commonly sales), including digital social. The selection of these models was based on the criteria of model stability (high R2, no autocorrelation, controlled heteroskedasticity) and enough variation in social activity (spend and impressions threshold of 5% per object). Some of the modelling periods were cut to account for sparse data, low correlation between creative impressions and modelled impressions or low variation. Therefore, a trusted relationship from social to the KPI of each MMM was established but could be enhanced by choosing more accurate parameterization of Meta activity through MMM model optimisation. Table 1 details the models included in the study. \\n </div>\\n\\n <p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n ![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part4/2.png)\\n\\nTable 1: Specifications of MMM models selected Detail of Models selected\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nOnce the MMM models were optimized, we isolated the impact of Meta on the KPI according to the following relationship:\\n <p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n***Meta Contribution to KPI = Coefficient of Meta Variable \xd7Transformed Meta Variable***\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\nThe Meta contribution became the dependent variable of the Sub-Model, along with the constant and residuals. The object detection impressions timeseries served as the explanatory variables. The objective of this was to understand the impact of different feature splits into the overall Meta performance, allowing room for movement through the constant and residuals. \\n\\nA sub-modelling approach allowed for the object detection features to have indirect effects on the KPI, through the Meta variable. Bayesian Optimisation Methods were employed to find the optimal transformations for each variable. \\n\\nEach Sub-model is a linear regression, testing the impact of the appearance of a feature, or feature group, and its opposite (partner feature) against the total Meta performance. Since the features are not mutually exclusive (between 48%-66% of creatives contained at least two objects), they could not all be tested in the same model. Furthermore, the daily impressions and spend per feature were split according to creative type. That is, the impressions associated with a feature or combination of features, e.g., Person & Product, were split out by static, video and carousel. While it was not in the scope of the study, doing this allowed for further analysis into the impact of features by creative type. \\n\\nA sequential approach was followed in which each feature group was tested in isolation. Within each sub-model, the transformations of the features (lag, adstock, and diminishing returns) which maximized R2, and minimized p-values were chosen. The transformations that the Meta features follow were bounded to the following ranges: lag of 0-3, adstock of 0-50, saturation (K; S) of 0.1-0.8; 1-9. \\n\\nAn example of sub-model is shown below.\\n\\n\\n ![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part4/9.png)\\n\\nWhere:\\n\\n<div align=\\"left\\">\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part4/10.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part4/11.png)\\n\\n\\nSame for Video (V) and Carousel (C)\\n\\nOne major challenge with the approach of testing the appearance of a feature or a set of features against its partner feature (e.g., impressions of creatives where a Brand Cue appears vs impressions of creatives where a Brand Cue does not appear), is that the partner feature is indirectly testing the appearance of other features or no features at all.\\nTo manage the risk of results inaccuracy we made sure that:\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n1. Both the main feature and the partner feature in the sub-models had to be statistically significant at a 10% level. For example, if the appearance of a feature is significant but the partner is not, the results of that regression were not used.\\n2. The percent of Impressions of the feature being tested had to be > 5%\\n\\n\\n## ROI Calculations\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nThe last step of the analysis centred around calculating ROIs and deriving ROI uplifts for each feature per brand, using the feature contributions from the sub-models and the associated spend. This involved the following steps:\\n\\n </div>\\n\\n1.\\tCalculate the ROI of each feature (and partnering feature/s) using the contribution and the spend associated with that feature.

Object Detection (OD) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) were used to detect specific features in creative images, such as faces, smiles, text, brand logos, etc. Then, in combination with impressions data, marketing mix models were used to investigate what objects, or combinations of objects in creative images in marketing campaigns, drive higher ROIs.\\nIn this Part III we explore the methodology for using Tesseract to detect text in creative images.\\n </div>\\n\\n## Detecting Text with Tesseract\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nTesseract is an open-source optical character recognition (OCR) Engine that allows for the recognition of text characters within a digital image. It is an open-source resource, originally developed by Hewlett-Packard, and now managed by Google. This package does not have any parameters to optimise, but, as is exposed here, the basic performance of this resource can be improved with a combination of image processing and detected text correction. \\n\\nIn this work, Tesseract was used to detect text in all images, in a process outlined in Figure 1. Performance of this detection tool was done using Confusion Matrices, to gain insight not only into the Accuracy, but also other metrics such as the True Positive and True Negative Rates.  \\n </div>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part3/10.PNG)\\n\\nFigure 1 - Three stage process by which the basic performance (accuracy) of Tesseract on the original images was improved by up to 28% points.\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nTo start with, the functionality was used on the original images to measure a baseline for performance on our sets of images. From this first step, we derived the following learnings:\\n\\n- For general Text (both non-promotional Text and Promotional Text), the Accuracy is 69%, the True Positive Rate is around 65%, the False Positive Rate is about 35%.\\n- Tesseract does not recognise symbols such as % (which may indicate promotional text) accurately.\\n- Tesseract does not perform well on images that have a busy background.\\n- Tesseract does not recognise slanted Text.\\n\\nBased on the low total volume of Promotional Text in our dataset, as well as the poor performance of Tesseract to detect Promotional Text, the decision was made to remove Promotional Text as one of the desired objects to study.\\n\\nBuilding on those learnings, we implemented a pipeline, outlined in Figure 2, that would help us improve the performance from baseline, by up to 28 percentage points on Accuracy : \\n </div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part3/11.PNG)\\n\\nFigure 2 - Pipeline for pre-processing images before Optical Character Recognition Models, and correcting detected text.\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nFor Step 1, pre-processing methods included the following, as well as combinations of those (illustrated in Figure 3): **Binary Threshold, Sharpen, Normalisation, Histogram Equalisation, Histogram Adaptive Equalisation**. As can be imagined, a processing method that enhances the performance of the detection method for one image, might decrease it for different images. Therefore, to ensure we obtained the highest accuracy for all images, we applied all pre-processing methods to all images, running Tesseract on each modified image, and keeping track of the text detected in each iteration. \\n </div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n ![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part3/12.PNG)\\n\\nFigure 3 - Effect of various image processing methods on the original.

Step 3 consisted of removing any \u201cincorrect\u201d text, such as text inside the bounding boxes of Logo or Product objects, if the text was shorter than a threshold length (which depended on the brand), if it consisted of keywords, such as the brand name, or if it had ASCII characters. \\n\\nWith the current methodology (figure 2), the accuracy cannot be improved any further by changing the length of text that is considered to be \u201ctrue\u201d Text. Furthermore, there is a trade-off between the True Negative Rate and the True Positive Rate, which helped us choose a threshold for the length of string to accept: Since Accuracy does not improve further after length 4, but this value does optimise the other two metrics, 4 characters long is the threshold chosen. \\n </div>\\n\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nThe performance of Tesseract may be improved further by adding another step to the pipeline in figure 2, where the image is rotated several degrees, and after each rotation, text is detected. Due to time constraint issues, and the fact that we had already achieved a significant improvement above baseline and reached an accuracy of high 90s for some of the brands, we did not implement this step.\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n## Code snippets\\n\\n### Install required libraries\\n\\n```\\n# To install tesseract\\n# !sh apt-get -f -y install tesseract-ocr \\n!sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr -y\\n\\n# To install pytesseract\\n!pip3 install pytesseract\\n```\\n\\n### Import required libraries\\n\\n```\\nimport pytesseract\\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score\\nimport cv2\\nfrom PIL import Image\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Processing images\\n\\n```\\ndef normalise_img(image):\\n            \\n    # normalise original and detect\\n    norm_img = np.zeros((image.shape[0], image.shape[1]))\\n    normalised = cv2.normalize(image, norm_img, 0, 255, cv2.NORM_MINMAX)\\n    normalised = cv2.threshold(normalised, 100, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)[1]\\n    normalised = cv2.GaussianBlur(normalised, (1, 1), 0)\\n    \\n    return normalised\\n```\\n\\n```\\ndef threshold_image(image, threshold=200):\\n    image = cv2.threshold(image, threshold, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)[1]\\n    return image\\n```   \\n    \\n```    \\ndef remove_noise_and_smooth(image):\\n\\n    # convert to grayscale\\n    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\\n\\n    # blur\\n    blur = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (0,0), sigmaX=33, sigmaY=33)\\n\\n    # divide\\n    divide = cv2.divide(gray, blur, scale=255)\\n\\n    # otsu threshold\\n    thresh = cv2.threshold(divide, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY+cv2.THRESH_OTSU)[1]\\n\\n    # apply morphology\\n    kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_RECT, (3,3))\\n    morph = cv2.morphologyEx(thresh, cv2.MORPH_CLOSE, kernel)\\n\\n    return morph\\n```\\n\\n```\\ndef im_to_gray(image):\\n    # convert to grayscale \\n    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\\n    return gray\\n ```\\n\\n```   \\ndef create_binary(image):\\n    # create binary -

Object Detection (OD) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) were used to detect specific features in creative images, such as faces, smiles, text, brand logos, etc. Then, in combination with impressions data, marketing mix models were used to investigate what objects, or combinations of objects in creative images in marketing campaigns, drive higher ROIs.\\nIn this Part II we explore the methodology for training Detectron2 models to detect brand-specific object in creative images.\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n## Why you should read this\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nThis article is mostly directed to machine learning practitioners. Here you will find a practical application of object detection algorithms; we present different open-source resources, comparisons and trade-offs in model selection for specific objects, methodology to improve performance for custom datasets, and how the object detection is then used to make inferences on the impact of creatives in marketing strategies.  \\n </div>\\n\\n\\n\\n## Dataset\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nOur dataset contained >50k image and video creatives across four different brands. The main goal of the custom object detection (OD) was to detect three types of brand-specific objects - logo, product and brand cue - as well as faces and smiles. Initially, faces and smiles were detected by pre-trained algorithms such as Haar cascades and Dlib, but due to the poor performance, it was decided to use a custom algorithm. \\n\\nBefore beginning the OD process, videos were converted to images by extracting every tenth frame. Training and Validation sets were then created using the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio labelling tool. The labels were then converted to COCO format, and registered in Detectron as custom COCO libraries. Read more about this in [Part I](https://ekimetrics.github.io/blog/2022/11/10/creative_execution_and_marketing_effectiveness_part_I). \\n\\n```\\n## Registering COCO format datasets\\nfrom detectron2.data.datasets import register_coco_instances\\n\\nregister_coco_instances(train, {\'thing_classes\': train_metadata.thing_classes, \'thing_dataset_id_to_contiguous_id\': train_metadata.thing_dataset_id_to_contiguous_id}, train_json_path, TRAINING_IMAGES_PATH)\\nregister_coco_instances(valid, {\'thing_classes\': valid_metadata.thing_classes, \'thing_dataset_id_to_contiguous_id\': valid_metadata.thing_dataset_id_to_contiguous_id}, valid_json_path, VALID_IMAGES_PATH)\\n```\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n## Algorithm\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nThe Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) model, Faster R-CNN X 101 32x8d FPN 3x, was used for the custom OD model.  \\n\\nOne model was trained per object per brand using the manually labelled training sets. For detecting faces and smiles, the training set consisted of creatives from all four brands, but each model was developed separately for face and smile per brand. In total there were, thus, 19 custom models. The validation set was used to tune hyperparameters of each model, with accuracy as the main metric. The final models were then used to detect objects in the unlabelled images for all four brands. The training, validation and final detections were all done using a single node GPU (CUDA) on Databricks.\\n </div>\\n\\n## Hyperparameter Tuning\\n### Process \\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nWhile Detectron2 allows for the customization of many configurations, including learning rate, backbone, image size, and number of images per batch, we limited the scope to just three parameters due to time constraints. These are summarized in Table 1 along with the parameter values tested. The choice of parameters was based on those deemed to be the most influential in performance. In addition to these parameters, the learning rate \u2013 the rate at which the algorithm converges to a solution   \u2013 was customized.  Rather than using the default value of 0.001, the learning rate was determined by the linear learning rate scaling rule. This was done in order to facilitate training on larger batch sizes.\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n <p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n ![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part2/1.png)\\n\\nTable 1: Parameters Tested in Custom Models\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExample Code\\n```\\n## Parameters values to test\\nparameters = {\\n    \'SOLVER.MAX_ITER\': [300, 500, 1000],\\n    \'ROI_HEADS.BATCH_SIZE_PER_IMAGE\': [265, 512, 1024]\\n}\\n\\n## Configuring the algorithmn\\ndef config_detectron(train_dataset, max_iter, batchsize):\\n    classes = MetadataCatalog.get(train_dataset).thing_classes\\n    num_classes = len(classes)\\n    print(f\\"Number of classes in dataset: {num_classes}\\")\\n    cfg = get_cfg()\\n    cfg.merge_from_file(model_zoo.get_config_file(\\"COCO-Detection/faster_rcnn_X_101_32x8d_FPN_3x.yaml\\"))\\n    cfg.DATASETS.TRAIN = (train_dataset, )\\n    cfg.DATASETS.TEST = ()\\n    cfg.DATALOADER.NUM_WORKERS = 0\\n    cfg.MODEL.WEIGHTS = model_zoo.get_checkpoint_url(\\"COCO-Detection/faster_rcnn_X_101_32x8d_FPN_3x.yaml\\") # Let training initialize from model zoo\\n    cfg.SOLVER.IMS_PER_BATCH = 2 ## # How many images per batch?

Object Detection (OD) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) were used to detect specific features in creative images, such as faces, smiles, text, brand logos, etc. Then, in combination with impressions data, marketing mix models were used to investigate what objects, or combinations of objects in creative images in marketing campaigns, drive higher ROIs.\\nIn this Part I we explore the methodology for using pre-trained Detectron2 models to detect brand-specific object in creative images.\\n\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n\x3c!-- import useBaseUrl from \\"@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\\";\\n\\n<link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"{useBaseUrl(\'katex/katex.min.css\')}\\" />\\n --\x3e\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## Why you should read this\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nThis article is primarily directed to machine learning practitioners. Here you will find a practical application of object detection algorithms. We present different open-source resources, comparisons and trade-offs in model selection for specific objects, and methodology to improve performance for custom data sets.\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n\\n## Manual labeling of the Training and Validation data sets\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nIn order to train custom train models (Part II of these series), as well as to evaluate the performance of all models, a proportion of the images were manually labeled in the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio labeling tool. The tool facilitates the interactive selection of the region of interest, and the labeling of said region with a pre-defined object label, as shown in Figure 1. \\n\\n </div>\\n\\n <p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/1.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 1 - Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio Image labeling Tool. Source: Microsoft.\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nBefore undertaking the task of manually labeling images, and specially if it is done by a team of people and not a single person, it is advisable to have a pre-defined set of rules on how to approach the task. For example: when labeling \u201cPerson\u201d, will you label only whole people? Or would you also label body parts as \\"Person\\"? Or at least those that show a face? - It is also important to ensure that all relevant objects in an image are labeled, specially in the validation data set, since that will constitute the ground truth when it comes to evaluating the performance of Object Detection models. When this is not done carefully, it becomes a problem, as some OD models might actually detect more objects than those which have been manually labeled.\\n\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n#### Distribution of Objects in Manually labeled Data set and Implications for the labeling of the Unlabeled Data set\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nThe train, validation and unlabeled data sets were created by taking random samples of all the creatives. This strategy generated a training and validation set that have very close matching distributions of the labels of interest, as shown in Figure 2. Therefore, we assessed that it is likely that the performance of the models (pre-trained or custom) on the validation data sets will be transferable to the unlabeled data sets.\\n\\n </div>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/2_v3.png)\\n\\nFigure 2 - The distribution of labeled objects in the Train (outer) and Validation (inner) data sets.\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n## Models\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nThe object detection process relied on a combination of pre-trained and custom-trained models from two Python libraries: Tesseract and Detectron2. Tesseract, an open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) library, was used for detecting text, while Detectron2, Facebook AI Research\'s next-generation platform for object detection and segmentation, was used for the remaining objects. We will explore the details of Tesseract in Part III of this series. From Detectron2, pre-trained object detection models were used for detecting common objects such as people, cars, and technology, while custom-trained models were used for detecting brand-specific objects such as logos (see Part II). Figure 3 outlines the objects detected by each model type.\\n\\n </div>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/3.png)\\n\\nFigure 3 - Object Detection using different pre-trained and custom-trained models.\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n### Pre-Trained Models\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nPre-trained Detectron2 models are trained on the Microsoft COCO (Common Objects in Context) data set [1]; a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning data set popularly used for computer vision projects. It contains over 200k labeled images, across 80 object categories (person, car, etc.) and 90 \\"stuff\\" (sky, grass, etc.) categories. However, for this study, we focused only on the detection of objects relating to the features of interest, detailed in figure 4. \\n\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/4.png)\\n\\nFigure 4 - COCO Objects Detected in Pre-Trained Models, Present in Creatives of Brands Studied\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n \\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n### Choosing a Detectron2 Pre-Trained Model\\nThe performance on Accuracy and Confidence Score (see figure 5 - Definition Box 1) were compared for three models : \\n\\n- Model 1: Faster R-CNN R50 FPN 1x \\n\\n- Model 2: Faster R-CNN R101 FPN 3x\\n\\n- Model 3: Faster R-CNN X 101 32x8d FPN 3x \\n\\nOverall, Model 3 has the highest average Accuracy while Model 2 has the highest average Confidence Score. The number of creatives with correctly identified objects is highest in Model 3. Figure 6 shows the results. \\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/5.png)\\n\\nFigure 5 - Definition Box 1\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n\\nMore in detail, for each object type: \\n- People: All three models have varying performance in detecting people across different brands. Overall, Model 3 has the highest accuracy.\\n- Technology: Model 2 is most confident in detecting tech, but misses tech in many creatives entirely. Overall, Model 3 has the highest accuracy.\\n- Cars: Model 3 has the highest average confidence and accuracy in detecting cars.\\n- Hotel Interiors and Food: Model 2 and Model 3 have a similar performance in detecting food and interior, both higher than Model 1.\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/6.png)\\n\\n Figure 6 - Comparison in performance on the validation data set of three pre-trained Detectron2 models.\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nFurthermore, Model 3 overcomes challenges faced by the other two models, such as identifying people in close-up shots, identifying cars from interior shots, and identifying technology when in a person\u2019s hand or lying on a table. \\n\\nFigures 7 and 8 show the performance of Model 3 on the specific Objects of interest. In particular, the Confidence Scores (figure 8) that lead to the high Accuracies in figure 7 range from between 80% to 98%. As we developed our methodology to be applicable regardless of the industry, we needed to choose a Confidence Score Threshold of Acceptance that is high enough to ensure accuracy, but not too high that it would miss objects of interest entirely. Therefore, a threshold of 85% confidence was selected.\\n\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/7.PNG)\\n\\nFigure 7 - Accuracy of Faster R-CNN X 101 32x8d FPN 3x on Specific Object Types.\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/8.PNG)\\n\\nFigure 8 - Average Confidence of Faster R-CNN X 101 32x8d FPN 3x on Specific Object Types.\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nFinally, since our creatives comprise of both still images, as well as frames extracted from video files, we wanted to make sure Object Detection was accurate in both types of images. Figure 9 shows the performance of Faster R-CNN X 101 32x8d FPN 3x (Model 3). The confidence scores do not differ significantly between frames and still images (at most 1.4% points). This means that the model can recognise object of interest with equal confidence in both types of images. The differences in performance may be attributed to people in frames more often being close-up; cartoons appear in frames while they are absent in stills; and frames of cars over-index on close-up shots and interior shots.\\nThe total detection time for all brands ranged 210 hours.\\n </div>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/9.PNG)\\n\\nFigure 9 - Performance of Faster R-CNN X 101 32x8d FPN 3x on Still vs Frame images.\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n### Useful links\\n- [Detectron2 - Github](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)\\n- [Detectron2 - Documentation](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\\n- [Detectron2 - ModelZoo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/main/MODEL_ZOO.md)\\n\\n## Snippets of code\\n\\n\\n\\n### Installations\\n\\n```\\n!pip install detectron2 -f https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detectron2/wheels/$CUDA_VERSION/torch$TORCH_VERSION/index.html\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Import libraries\\n```\\nimport detectron2\\nfrom detectron2.engine import DefaultPredictor\\nfrom detectron2.config import get_cfg\\nfrom detectron2.data import MetadataCatalog, data setCatalog\\nfrom detectron2.utils.visualizer import ColorMode, Visualizer\\nfrom detectron2 import model_zoo\\nfrom detectron2.evaluation import COCOEvaluator, inference_on_data set\\nfrom detectron2.data import build_detection_test_loader\\n\\nfrom PIL import Image\\nimport cv2\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Define detector class\\n```\\nclass Detector:\\n    \\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.cfg = get_cfg()\\n        \\n        #

Stay tuned! \\n\\n## Appendix \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Resources\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nAn Azure Resource Group was set up in order to manage the Storage, Code Development and Machine Learning Studio functionalities. All the data was stored in Azure Storage. All code to process images, and implement Object Detection was written in Python scripts, in Azure Databricks notebooks. labeling of images was done in Azure Machine Learning Studio.\\nCustom-trained models were trained and validated, and the unlabeled data set was labeled using the chosen models (both pre-trained and custom-trained), in a GPU cluster (Databricks Runtime Version 9.1 LTS ML includes Apache Spark 3.1.2, GPU, Scala 2.12 with Node Type Standard_NC_12 112 GB memory and 2 GPUs). Images were funnelled through the models in chunks of 200 images.\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n### Detectron2\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nDetectron2 is a Facebook AI Research (FAIR) open-source library that provides object detection and segmentation algorithms [2-5]. It is implemented in PyTorch, and includes state-of-the-art algorithms like RetinaNet, Mask R-CNN, TensorMark and Faster R-CNN. Its training pipeline is GPU-run, making it fast and highly scalable. Furthermore, its modular nature allows for custom models to be created within an existing object detection framework. As a result, it was more suited for the needs of this study than other common object detection libraries like Yolov4. \\n\\nFor both the pre-trained and custom models, a Faster R-CNN algorithm was used due to its speed and high performance on small object detection. This algorithm combines two network models: Fast R-CNN (Region based Convolutional Neural Network), a deep learning algorithm which generates a convolutional feature map, and RPN (Regi on Proposal Networks), a convolutional network that proposes regions. \\n\\nThe specific model used was Faster R-CNN X 101 32x8d FPN 3x, a Faster R-CNN model developed by Detectron2 which uses a FPN (Feature Pyramid Networks) backbone, and a learning rate schedule of 3x. This model was chosen based on the baseline performances reported by FAIR, which highlight this model as having the highest average precision and training memory. For more information. Furthermore, the model was tested and evaluated against the performance of other Faster R-CNN models on objects the models are pre-trained on, against out Validation set.  Figure 6 shows the results.\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n\\n### Manipulating Bounding Boxes\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nDifferent technologies (Azure, Detectron2, Tesseract) have different formats when it comes to annotating the bounding boxes [6]. Therefore, it was necessary to manipulate the bounding boxes as follows (figure 10):\\n\\nIn order to train the Custom-Trained Models, the Azure format was converted to the Detectron2 format: COCO bounding box (bbox) is defined as [x_min, y_min, width, height]. \\n\\nJSON files exported from Azure Data labeling have bounding boxes that are normalised. Detectron2 expect the bounding boxes in absolute values. Therefore, we transformed the attribute \'bbox\' of the COCO file downloaded from Azure ML Studio to denormalise it, and added the \'bbox_mode\' attribute to be equal to 1 (XYWH_ABS 0). We also add the pair \\"iscrowd:0\\" to each annotation [8].\\n\\nIn order to limit the region in images for text detection to outside of Logo and Product objects, Detectron2 format was transformed to Tesseract format: Detectron2 format [X, Y, W, H] to the Tesseract format (x1=X, x2=W+X, y1=Y, y2=H+Y).\\n </div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/14.PNG)\\n\\nFigure 10 - Manipulation of bounding boxes to accommodate each technology.

The second transformation was necessary to limit the region in images for text detection to anything outside of logo or product objects.\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n### Detecting Faces with Open libraries with Pre-Trained Models \\nTo detect Faces and Smiles, we began by exploring open libraries that have pre-trained models for this purpose. Figure 11 shows some of the libraries available, as well as those we tested.\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/15.PNG)\\n\\nFigure 11 - Open libraries with pre-trained models that detect faces and smiles, and those we tested.\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nWe tested three different open libraries that are optimised for face detection. The Haar Cascades model has two parameters that need to be optimised, so we set up two sets of 52 experiments to find the optimum models that detect Faces and Smiles. Visually, it was clear that the models had a very high rate of False Positives, therefore we enhanced the detection algorithm by limiting the detection zone for smiles to be only inside the bounding boxes of faces, as shown in figure 12. \\n </div>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/16.PNG)\\n\\nFigure 12 - Smiles being detected inside faces only was a necessary methodology we implemented, to improve the accuracy of open libraries that detect faces and smiles.\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\nFurthermore, as there were no ready-made functions in the libraries to assess the performance of predictions, we developed a method that compared the intersection of the bounding boxes between of the manually labeled and predicted objects, as shown in figure 13. All the models tested suffered from having a high False Positive Rate. The best performing model was with library DLIB, with an Accuracy of 59%, a True Positive Rate of 41% and a False Positive Rate of 36%. Therefore, we needed a better methodology for detecting Faces and Smiles, so we tested training a custom Detectron2 model to do so, as described in Part III of this series. \\n </div>\\n\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Eki_Meta/Part1/17.PNG)\\n\\nFigure 13 - Methodology for assessing whether a predicted label for Face or Smile is accurate.

We show that the attention coefficients specific to BERT architecture constitute a particularly rich piece of information that can be used to perform interpretability. There are mainly two ways to do interpretability: attribution and generation of counterfactual examples. In a first article, we showed how attention coefficients could be the basis of an attribution interpretability method. Here we propose to evaluate how they can also be used to set up counterfactuals. \\n</div>\\n\\n\\n <div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\n## Work presented in the previous article\\n\\nPreviously, the BERT [1] and DistilBERT [2] models have been mobilized to tackle the well-known problem of sentiment analysis. In particular, we have shown that the BERT and DistilBERT models contain within their architecture attention coefficients that can be at the heart of an attribution interpretability method. Starting from an initial text, a visualization of the weight assignment method was proposed. The more red the color, the higher the associated attention coefficient. \\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n ![screenshot-app](img/Interpretability_sentiment_analysis/Part_II/Image_2.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 1 - Attention-Based token importance\\n</div>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n We saw that the word groups \\"_favorite movie_\\", \\"_it just never gets old_\\", \\"_performance brings tears_\\", or \\"_it is believable and startling_\\" stood out. This explained well why the algorithm evaluated the review as positive and what was the semantic field at the root of this prediction. This work was done using the Hugging Face transformers library [3].\\n\\n## Interpreting through counterfactual generation\\n\\nAnother way to do interpretability is to generate counterfactual examples. According to Judea Pearl, counterfactual \\"involves answering questions which ask what might have been, had circumstances been different\u201d [4]. Thus, the idea is to understand a prediction by generating a counterfactual example, resulting in an opposite prediction. In the context of natural language processing, it is therefore a matter of changing the right words in the review. In order to generate a counterfactual example, we propose the following methodology:\\n- Compute the attention coefficients of the tokens in a text corpus on each attention layer (6). The text corpus size must be statistically significant \\n- Perform token clustering based on their 6-dimensional representation\\n- Detect clusters associated with positively and negatively charged sentiment words\\n- Replace the tokens with the highest average attention with their \\"opposite token\\" in their \\"opposite cluster\\"\\nThis approach allows us to validate the interpretative strength of the tokens put forward by the attention coefficients, while illustrating what a close review would have been with an opposite sentiment. \\nWe apply the methodology on a corpus of 1000 reviews. The clustering method used is the hierarchical ascending classification (HAC) and gives 3 clusters. The obtained clusters and the counterfactual generation procedure can be represented in 2 dimensions as follows:\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n ![screenshot-app](img/Interpretability_sentiment_analysis/Part_II/Image_3.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 2 - Token clusters & replacements\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe then generate the counterfactual example of the review tested earlier by changing 2 words: \\n\\n\\n <div align=\\"center\\"> \\ndelight \u27a1 torment\\n\\nfavorite \u27a1 worst\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nThis gives us the following counterfactual example:\\n\\n\u201c_Probably my all time worst movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause but its not preachy or boring . it just never gets old despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years . paul lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a torment. the kids are as grandma says more like dressedup midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch . and the mothers slow awakening to whats happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling . if i had a dozen thumbs they\u2019d all be up for this movie_\\".\\n\\nAs the text is quite long, 2 tokens are not enough to change the feeling associated with the review. The probability score nevertheless drops significantly by 0.3pts.\\nOne way to assess the quality of the generated counterfactual examples is to evaluate the proportion of reviews in a corpus whose associated sentiment has changed. The result can be represented as a \\"counterfactual confusion matrix\\" as follows:\\n\\n\\nOne way to assess the quality of the generated counterfactual examples is to evaluate the proportion of reviews in a corpus whose associated sentiment has changed. The result can be represented as a \\"counterfactual confusion matrix\\" as follows:\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n ![screenshot-app](img/Interpretability_sentiment_analysis/Part_II/Image_4.jpg)\\n\\nTable 1 - Counterfactual confusion matrix example\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere :\\n- X<sub>11</sub> represents the share of reviews whose initial associated sentiment and the sentiment of the counterfactual example are positive; sentiment has remained the same \\n- X<sub>12</sub> represents the share of reviews whose sentiment changed from positive to negative; sentiment did change \\n- X<sub>21</sub> represents the share of reviews whose sentiment changed from negative to positive; sentiment changed well\\n- X<sub>22</sub> represents the share of reviews whose initial associated sentiment and the sentiment of the counterfactual example are negative; sentiment has remained the same\\n\\nWe compute the \\"counterfactual confusion matrix\\" on the same text corpus that enabled us to perform clustering, picking 5 tokens for each review. The result is given below:\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n ![screenshot-app](img/Interpretability_sentiment_analysis/Part_II/Image_5.jpg)\\n\\nTable 2 - Actual counterfactual confusion matrix\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n <p>&nbsp;</p>\\nThus, we see that changing the 5 tokens with the highest average attention produces a change in sentiment perception in 44% of cases. In particular, the rate of sentiment change for reviews initially perceived as positive is 31% while the rate of sentiment change for reviews initially perceived as negative is 53%. The change from negative to positive seems to be better achieved with our method.\\n\\nWe have shown that attention coefficients can be a source of interpretability. Used in the right way, the attention coefficients allow the detection of tokens with high predictive value. They can also be used to generate counterfactual examples in order to better understand what the sentence should have been in order to be associated with an opposite sentiment. The interest of the attention coefficients is reinforced by the \\"counterfactual confusion matrix\\": The high transformation rate of the reviews\' sentiments shows that the tokens selected thanks to the attention are strongly meaningful.\\n\\n## Next step\\nWe plan to test other ways to generate counterfactual examples. One way would be to take advantage of the way DistilBert has been trained: the mask language modeling (MLM). The idea would be to mask the tokens with high average attention, and replace them with the tokens with the highest softmax in the \\"opposite cluster\\". This would ensure the grammatical correctness of the generated counterfactual example. Finally, the generation of counterfactual examples can have other applications than interpretability. In particular, it becomes possible to perform data augmentation in order to give more examples to a model. It can mitigate biases by balancing the sentiments of biased discriminated populations. This would improve fairness indicators while not degrading accuracy. \\n\\n## References\\n[1] VASWANI, Ashish, SHAZEER, Noam, PARMAR, Niki, et al. Attention is all you need.

There are mainly two ways to do interpretability: attribution and generation of counterfactual examples. Here we propose to evaluate how attention coefficients can form the basis of an attribution method. We will show in a second article how they can also be used to set up counterfactuals. \\n</div>\\n\\n\\n## The BERT architecture\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nAn artificial neural network is a computer system inspired by the functioning of the human brain and biological neurons to learn specific tasks. The neural networks represent a subset of machine learning algorithms. In order to perform a learning task, the neural network spreads information through an elementary network, called a perceptron. The way in which information is diffused can be formalized through linear algebra and the manipulation of various activation functions. A neural network can be defined as an association of elementary objects called formal neurons, like the perceptron. There are several types of layers that can be part of a neural network:\\n\\n- Fully connected layers, which receive a vector as input, and produce a new vector as output by applying a linear combination and possibly an activation function;\\n- Convolution layers, which learn localized patterns in space;\\n- Attention layers, which model the general relations between different objects.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nAttention mechanisms are particularly effective for natural language processing tasks. This is mainly due to the fact that they allow to properly model a word through mathematical representations. In particular, attention layers make it possible to assign a contextual representation of the word on a case-by-case basis. This makes it a much more efficient tool than Word2vec since the latter only models an average context, but does not adapt to the given situation. Attention mechanisms are at the heart of Transformers-type models as shown in the diagram below. The BERT model corresponds to a stack of the left part of the generic architecture of a Transformer [1].\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Interpretability_sentiment_analysis/part_I/Image_2.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 1 - Transformers architecture\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n ## Fine tuning of BERT for sentiment analysis\\n\\n <div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nTo illustrate how attention coefficients can be a source of interpretability in natural language processing, we propose to fine tune a DistilBERT for sentiment analysis. A DistilBERT is a distilled version of BERT. It is smaller, faster, cheaper, lighter and recovers 97% of BERT\u2019s performance on GLUE [2]. A perfect compromise, in fact. Most transformers are available pre-trained on the Hugging Face transformers library [3]. The objective is to perform supervised classification on the IMDB database to assess the sentiment associated with a movie review. An illustration of the dataset is shown below:\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/Interpretability_sentiment_analysis/part_I/Image_3.jpg)\\n\\n Figure 2 - IMDB sample\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n To do so, we import all the libraries needed.  In particular, the tokenizer DistilBertTokenizer and the pre-trained hugging face model TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification are used.\\n\\n ```\\ntokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained(\'distilbert-base-uncased\')\\nsentence_encoder = TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\'distilbert-base-uncased\', output_attentions = True)\\n```\\n\\n\\nThe parameter \\"output_attention\\" must be equal to \\"True\\". It will allow us to retrieve the attention coefficients of the model. We add a dense layer with a softmax activation to fine tune the model to do sentiment analysis. In order to train the model, we use the following hyperparameters:\\n\\n- initial_lr  = 1e-5\\n- n_epochs    = 15\\n- batch_size  = 64\\n- random_seed = 42\\n\\nFinally, we make evolve the learning and stop the learning process if the val_loss does not decrease after a certain number of iterations. \\n\\n```\\nreduce_lr = ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor=\'val_loss\', factor=0.2, verbose = 1,min_delta=0.005,patience=3, min_lr=3e-7)\\n\\nearly_stop = EarlyStopping(monitor=\'val_loss\', min_delta=0, patience=6, verbose=1, mode=\'auto\',baseline=None, restore_best_weights=True)\\n```\\n\\nWe can finally fine tune the DistilBert.\\n```\\nhistory = model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=bs, epochs=n_epochs, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), \\n                    verbose=1,callbacks=[early_stop, reduce_lr])\\n```\\n\\nWe obtain a val_accurcay of 85%, which is sufficient for our further analysis. Note that a BERT or a RoBERTa would have certainly had a better val_loss, as they are more heavy and complex.\\n\\n## Recovery of attention coefficients\\nWe are now able to analyze the attention coefficients related to movie reviews. In order to retrieve it, We need to predict the sentiment associated to a review.\\nThen, we select the layer(s) of attention to analyze. We focus here on the last layer of attention.\\n\\n```\\ninputs = tokenizer.batch_encode_plus(reviews,truncation=True, \\n                                     add_special_tokens = True, \\n                                     max_length = max_len, \\n                                     pad_to_max_length = True)\\n\\ntokenized = np.array(inputs[\\"input_ids\\"]).astype(\\"int32\\")\\nattention_mask = np.array(inputs[\\"attention_mask\\"]).astype(\\"int32\\")\\nencoded_att = model.layers[2](tokenized,attention_mask =attention_mask)\\n#last attention layer\\nlast_attention=encoded_att.attentions[-1]\\n```\\n\\nWe finally recovered the 12 attention matrices from the last layer of the DistilBert.\\n\\n## Interpreting through attention attribution\\nA first way to take advantage of the attention coefficients is to directly look at their value in order to evaluate if the right words stand out. We choose to calculate the average attention on all attention layers and heads. A more in-depth work of selection of the most relevant layer would allow to refine the interpretability method. Here, we limit ourselves to the most basic case.\\n\\n```\\na,b = [], []\\nfor head in range(0,12) :\\n    for i, elt in enumerate(inputs[\'input_ids\'][0]):\\n        if np.array(elt) != 1:\\n            att = last_attention.numpy()[0,head][0][i]\\n            a.append(tokenizer.decode([elt]) + \'_\' + str(i))\\n            b.append(att)\\n            \\nattention_all_head=pd.DataFrame({\\"Token\\":a,\\"Attention coefficient\\":b})\\n```\\n\\nIn order to have the average attention, we group by the attention score on all the layers and heads.\\nWe finally have the average attention coefficients associated with the words of the film review. As an example, the attention coefficients associated with the following positive review is calculated:\\n\\n\u201c_Probably my all time favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause but its not preachy or boring . it just never gets old despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years . paul lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a delight . the kids are as grandma says more like dressedup midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch . and the mothers slow awakening to whats happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling . if i had a dozen thumbs they\u2019d all be up for this movie_\\".\\n\\nThe review being long, we represent the text in color. The more red the color, the higher the associated attention coefficient. The result is shown below:\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n ![screenshot-app](img/Interpretability_sentiment_analysis/part_I/Image_4.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 3 - Attention-Based token importance\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n <p>&nbsp;</p>\\nWe see that the word groups \\"favorite movie\\", \\"it just never gets old\\", \\"performance brings tears\\", or \\"it is believable and startling\\" stand out. This explains well why the algorithm evaluated the review as positive and what was the semantic field at the root of this prediction.\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n## Next step\\nWe will show in a future article how attention coefficients are useful for generating counterfactual examples to explain the model prediction.\\n\\n\\n## References\\n\\n[1] VASWANI, Ashish, SHAZEER, Noam, PARMAR, Niki, et al.

The main objective of this article is to introduce Reinforcement Learning as a way to solve combinatorial optimization problems (Reinforcement Learning can actually be used to solve a much wider range of optimization problems). \\n\\nFirst, the classical Reinforcement Learning framework will be briefly presented. Then, we\'ll see how to frame the multi-knapsack problem for Reinforcement Learning, followed by explanations on why we chose to explore RL for this combinatorial optimization problem. Eventually, the Q-learning (no neural networks) and Policy Gradient (with neural networks) approaches will be introduced and their performance will be evaluated on the knapsack problem.\\n\\n\\n## Reinforcement Learning for the Knapsack problem \\n\\n### What is Reinforcement Learning?\\n\\nThe image below represents the Reinforcement Learning framework. It describes in a simple, yet accurate manner, one of the main ideas behind Reinforcement Learning. \\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/reinforcement-learning-framework.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 1 : The Reinforcement Learning framework\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\nBasically, an agent receives information about the state of an environment he evolves in, information we will call S<sub>t</sub> as it describes the state at timestep t.\\n\\nBased on this information it receives, the RL agent will choose an action among all the actions it has the right to take at each timestep. We will call such action A<sub>t</sub>, the action at time t, with A<sub>t</sub> belonging to AA<sub>t</sub>(s<sub>t</sub>) the set of available actions given the state S<sub>t</sub>. When an action is taken, it has an impact on the environment and the agent will receive information about the new state of the environment S<sub>t+1</sub> but also a reward to incentivize it to take actions which will maximize the total rewards it expects to obtain at the end of an episode.\\n\\nTo apply reinforcement learning to solve business problems, these problems have to be framed as a Markov Decision Process, as seen above. More details can be found on how to rigorously define the Reinforcement Learning in the [excellent course given by David Silver](https://deepmind.com/learning-resources/-introduction-reinforcement-learning-david-silver) (principal research scientist at DeepMind, now owned by Google). You may find his lectures using the previous link, with lectures 1 and 2 being the most pertinent.\\n\\nNow, to get a better grasp on how to frame a problem for Reinforcement Learning, let\u2019s consider two practical examples.\\n\\nAs a first example, we can consider for instance an AI trader. It could have as available actions the possibility to buy or sell many different products. Its actions have an impact on the environment. First, the money it has and the products it owns will be modified, but also if it buys a massive amount of a certain product, it may have an important impact on the future prices. The final goal for it may be to earn as much money as possible. The description of this first example with the prism of Reinforcement Learning is given in figure 2.\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/Example_AI_Trader_no_logo.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Figure 2 - Example of an AI trader described through the prism of Reinforcement Learning\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\nFor the case of a self driving car as the AI agent, the actions it can take could be turning, stopping, accelerating. The information it will receive at each timestep are the speed of the car, its geolocation and probably many others. The environment can be the real world around the car, or just a simulator. The final reward will take into account how fast the car has reached a certain goal position, without damaging things or killing people for instance. Should it damage objects, it could for instance receive negative rewards. This information is summarized in the figure 3 below.\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/Example_self_driving_car_no_logo.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Figure 3 - Example of a self driving car described through the prism of Reinforcement Learning\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\nLet\u2019s now tackle the case of the multi-knapsack problem!\\n\\n### How to adapt the multi-Knapsack problem for solving with Reinforcement Learning\\n\\nThe precise definition of the multi-knapsack problem was given in the first part of this serie of articles on the knapsack problem. The figure below describes visually the problem at stake.\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/Knapsack_problem_5.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Figure 4 - Description of the multi-knapsack problem\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nIn our case, one could think about the agent as a person trying to carefully choose among the many clothes he/she possesses before going on a long trip. The environment would be the empty bags and all the clothes to choose from. At each timestep, the person would have the choice to take one element among the available clothes to put it inside one of the bags, the bags needing to be closed (and thus not to full) before leaving for the trip.\\n\\nThe objective is to maximize the value of the clothes chosen for the trip.\\n\\n\\nAnd that\u2019s it! Our problem is framed for Reinforcement Learning.\\n\\n\\n### Why we chose to explore RL for combinatorial optimization problems\\nThe last two decades have known the breakthrough of Deep Learning which is now massively entering all fields of industry whether this is for Computer Vision, disease predictions, product recommendation, Natural Language Processing applications, etc. Massive investments follow in the field of Machine Learning implying a virtuous circle with more results and regular new breakthroughs. Due to these developments, Deep Reinforcement Learning has emerged from the field of Reinforcement Learning which has been studied for a long time and whose goal is to take actions in an environment in order to maximize a defined cumulative reward. This allowed new recent breakthroughs, such as the AI AlphaGo beating professional Go players in 2016 and more recently AlphaStar beating world champions of the video game Starcraft (more on that in [DeepMind blog article](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii) or in the [Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1724-z.epdf?author_access_token=lZH3nqPYtWJXfDA10W0CNNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PSZcPzJFGNAZhOlk4deBCKzKm70KfinloafEF1bCCXL6IIHHgKaDkaTkBcTEv7aT-wqDoG1VeO9-wO3GEoAMF9bAOt7mJ0RWQnRVMbyfgH9A%3D%3D)). \\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/AlphaStar_Image.png)\\n\\nFigure 5 - Visualization highlighting the trained AlphaStar performing against a top Starcraft human players\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nWe\u2019ll say a few words about this video game environment, because this achievement is one of the reasons which motivates the use of Reinforcement Learning for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Indeed, with the knapsack problem, we have a discrete action space with a limited number of actions, although the range of available actions can become extremely high by changing the number of available items and knapsacks. \\n\\nHaving an AI agent beating the world\u2019s best players on this game is an important breakthrough as this video game environment is extremely complex, with only imperfect information being provided to the agent, the action space being enormous with a choice between up to 10<sup>26</sup> different actions, and actions being taken almost in real time, every 0.2 seconds. Eventually, planning is made on long term and the agent doesn\u2019t know until the end of the game whether it has won the game or not. While applying Deep Reinforcement Learning to video games allows to test the performance of the algorithms very accurately, allowing to judge how it performs in very different environments, applications also begin to appear in other fields, opening the perspective of using these techniques in different industry fields in the next few years. Deep Reinforcement Learning is definitely a field with high potential, and proofs have been shown that it can solve very well high-dimensional problems. Especially, many articles were published where these algorithms were applied to finance problems.\\n\\nNow that we have seen the potential of Reinforcement Learning for solving a problem such as the knapsack problem, it is important to keep in mind some important characteristics of Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches: \\n\\n- Reinforcement Learning algorithms provides us with approximations of the optimal solutions on the contrary to the solutions that could provide Mixed Integer Programming solvers as the ones introduced in the first part of this series of articles on the knapsack problem;\\n- For the same reason, Reinforcement Learning algorithms will always provide us solutions to the problem, on the contrary to exact methods which could be unable to provide any solution for very complex problems. For that reason, Reinforcement Learning approaches are for instance being developed in order to solve partial differential equations of very high dimensionality, where usual solvers are unable to provide a solution;\\n- Reinforcement Learning algorithms perform online optimization, meaning that once they have been trained, they are able to solve very complex problems immediately. They have thus tremendous potential for applications which require to solve problems very frequently in a limited time window, such as in trading or product recommendation for instance.\\n\\nAs seen in the beginning of this section, Reinforcement Learning algorithms have a very high potential for a wide range of business problems. Let\'s now introduce one of the two Reinforcement Learning approaches used in this notebook. The first one, the Q-learning approach, isn\'t based on neural networks and doesn\'t scale well when the dimensionality of the problem increases. We have studied it as it is at the core of other important algorithms such as Deep Q Learning, much more powerful. We will thus concentrate on another promising approach, based on neural networks: the Policy Gradient approach.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Using Q-Learning and Policy Gradient algorithms on the Knapsack problem\\n\\n### A simple introduction to Policy Gradient \\nThe basic principle with a policy gradient approach is that, for each state _s_ received as input, our algorithm will provide us a probability distribution for the actions to take, allowing us to know which object our algorithm recommands us to put first in the knapsack.\\n\\nIn the formula below, \ud835\udf0b gives us this probability. More precisely, \ud835\udf0b gives us the probability to take action _a_ knowing that we currently at state _s_ and given the \ud835\udf03 values of the model parameters, neurons in our case as we use neural networks. \\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/policy_gradient_equation_2.svg)\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nThe use of neural networks isn\'t mandatory here, but very frequent to obtain good results on complex problems. An example of a representation of a simple neural network is given recalled below.  \\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/classical_neural_network_image_2.png)\\n\\nFigure 6 - Representation of a simple neural network\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nOur model architecture can be visualized with this representation. If we dig a bit deeper into the details of our model\'s architecture, we have:\\n\\n- As input of the neural network, a description of the current state of the system, that is the value and price information for all items, information about the already selected items and about the current and maximum weight limit inside the different bags;\\n\\n- Thanks to this information, our model associates to each possible action a probability and we can then select the action that the algorithm recommends us to take first, that is which object should be stored in which knapsack at the current timestep. This is the output of our model;\\n\\n- The parameters of this model, the neurons, are updated at the end of each episode, an episode beginning when all the objects are available and ending when the bags are sufficiently full (or all objects have been selected...). The update of the parameters (\ud835\udf03) of the model taking place at the end of each episode only and not each time an action is proposed by the model, the approach is called a __Monte Carlo approach__;\\n\\n- The updates of the parameters are made in order to maximize the value of the items stored inside the knapsacks and this approach is based on techniques such as __stochastic gradient descent__.\\n\\nNow that the Policy Gradient has been described, let\'s see how our algorithms performed on the knapsack problem!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Evaluating the performance of the RL algorithms\\n\\nAs summarized in figure 7 below, in order to evaluate the performance of the different algorithms, we chose to apply our two RL algorithms (Q-Learning and Policy Gradient) to 3 different environments of increasing difficulty. We trained each algorithm over 400 episodes.\\n\\nAt the beginning of a new experience, the algorithm had all its coefficients reinitialized. We perform several experiences in order to evaluate how robust is the algorithm. \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/evaluation_rl_algos_2.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Figure 7 - Description of the evaluation process for the different algorithms\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\nEventually, we evaluated the performance of the algorithms with 3 metrics:\\n- The mean reward shows how good on average the algorithm is;\\n- The standard deviation highlights the potential lack of robustness of the algorithm;\\n- The performance ratio RL vs MILP tells us how close is the RL algorithm to the optimal solution provided by a MILP solver (details on how to obtain such a solution are given in the notebook). \\n\\n\\n\\n### Results with Q-Learning (no neural networks)\\n\\nThe graphs on the left show that overall our Q-Learning algorithm does indeed improve through training as its reward improved over time. However, we can see that the performance ratio RL vs MILP is very low, meaning that it is far from achieving as good results as what we could get using state-of-the-art MILP solvers.\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/performance_q_learning_knapsack_4.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Figure 8 - Performance of the Q-Learning algorithm\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nFurthermore, environments of increasing complexity / dimensionality will be much more difficult to handle for Q-Learning, as its Q-value matrix has as number of columns the number of items multiplied by the number of knapsacks and as rows all the possible states which could exist. Increasing only slightly the number of knapsacks or bags will thus quickly make the Q-Learning algorithm unusable.\\n\\n### Results with Policy Gradient (based on neural networks)\\n\\nThe results of the learning process with Policy Gradient are much better than with Q-learning. At the beginning, due to random initialization of the neural network parameters, the actions are taken at random and the reward is very low, but it quickly improves until reaching a local maximum, not global as it is still lower than the solution obtained with the MILP solver. \\n\\nThe performance ratio is quite good on the three different environments, reaching approximately 80% for each. The algorithm scales well when the complexity increases.\\n\\nWe see however that the standard deviation is quite high, which highlights the fact that each time a model is initialized, it can converge to quite different values. It is thus not extremely robust and several initializations are required before finding good results approaching the optimal solution.\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/performance_policy_gradient_knapsack_2.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Figure 9 - Performance of the REINFORCE (policy-gradient approach) algorithm\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nOn the graph below are highlighted some of the limitations we have witnessed with Policy Gradient algorithms such as the REINFORCE algorithm. We have a lack of robustness, having our algorithm sometimes working very well, sometimes leading to a poorer reward.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/robustness_pb_policy_gradient_2.png)\\n\\nFigure 10 - REINFORCE algorithm (gradient-policy approach) appears as lacking robustness\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\nFor that reason, the hyperparameter tuning is made more complicated. Indeed comparing one combination of hyperparameters with another one isn\'t enough to be certain about which combination of hyperparameters is the best, because of the high variability of results for fixed hyperparameters. \\n\\n## Opening\\n\\nFor obtaining the results given in this article, we reproduced classical Reinforcement Learning algorithms: the Q-learning algorithm which does not rely on the use of neural networks, and a Policy Gradient algorithm which relies on neural networks. We saw that the latter obtained much better results than the former as we could expect. \\n\\nWe also built our own multi-knapsack environment file, allowing us to easily modify greatly the complexity of the environment by increasing both the number of available items to put in the knapsacks and the number of knapsacks. \\n\\nWhile creating the environment file, we followed the nomenclature proposed by Open AI Gym for building Reinforcement Learning environments, using the same method names used to define an Open AI Gym environment. The objective was to be able to experiment much more quickly in the future by making use of one of the different Deep Reinforcement Learning libraries (Stable Baselines, TF Agents, Tensorforce\u2026). Indeed, these libraries allow access to many different advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms already implemented, which can directly be used on new problems if the environment file describing the problem has been built using Open AI Gym nomenclature.\\n\\nAnother article will be written soon to tell more about how to perform hyperparameter tuning for RL using the hyperparameter optimization framework [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) and how to compare and evaluate the efficiency of many different RL algorithms using [Stable Baselines](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/)!\\n\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"/2022/08/27/traditional_or","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/08/27/traditional_or","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-27-traditional_or.md","title":"Deep RL and Optimization applied to Operations Research problem - 1/2 Traditional Optimization techniques","description":"This article is part of a series of articles which will introduce several optimization techniques, from traditional (yet advanced) Mathematical Optimization solvers and associated packages to Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms, while tackling a very famous Operations Research problem: the multi-knapsack problem.

Then, the multi-knapsack problem itself is introduced. Then we apply the rules defined before on how to solve optimization problems and obtain the optimal solution to the multi-knapsack problem, formulated as a Mixed Integer problem and using Python-MIP package. Let\'s now introduce simple steps one can follow to approach optimization problems with optimization solvers.\\n\\n\\n## Main steps while creating an optimization model to solve a business problem\\n\\nOnce a business problem that could benefit from optimization has been identified, we can define a systematic approach based on 3 steps for solving all kind of optimization problems with optimization solvers. These 3 steps are highlighted in the figure below.\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/3_steps_math_modelling_4.png)\\n\\nFigure 1 : The 3 main steps for solving a business problem through optimization\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n\\nIn more details, these 3 steps are: \\n\\n1. __Create the conceptual mathematical model__ that defines the different variables, constraints, etc. in the business problem. This step consists in writing down on paper the equations that define our problem. \\n\\n2. __Translate the conceptual mathematical model into a computer program__. For most programming languages used for optimization, the computer program will largely resembles the mathematical equations one would write on paper.\\n\\n3. __Solve the mathematical model using a math programming solver__. The solver available for Mathematical Programming (solvers such as GLPK, Gurobi, CPLEX...) relies on very sophisticated algorithms. Important algorithms and ideas used in these solvers are, among many others: simplex method, branch & bound, use of heuristics...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLet\'s see those 3 steps for the case of the multi-knapsack problem.\\n\\n\\n## The multi-knapsack problem\\n\\n\\nThe objective here is, given a set of _n_ items and a set of _m_ knapsacks, to __maximize__ the total value of the items put in the knapsacks without exceeding their capacity.\\n\\nBelow,  w<sub>i</sub> represents the weight of item i,  p<sub>i</sub> the value of item i while  c<sub>j</sub> represents the capacity of knapsack j.\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/Knapsack_problem_5.png)\\n\\nFigure 2: Description of the multi-knapsack problem\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n\\nThe multi-knapsack is an extension of the classical knapsack problem where instead of considering only one knapsack, we consider as many as we want. This allows to easily extend the complexity of this problem.\\n\\nWhile the problem is relatively easy to define mathematically, it belongs to the class of NP-hard problems. Without going into the details of what defines NP-hard problems, we can easily see that the complexity of the knapsack problems explodes when the number of knapsacks and items increases. Indeed, we have m<sup>n</sup> available combinations we would need to test should we want to apply a brute-force approach for solving this problem. Just with 10 knapsacks and 80 items, there are 10<sup>80</sup> combinations, which is the estimation of the number of atoms in the universe! And 10 knapsacks and 80 items is still quite limited... Let\'s now try to create the conceptual mathematical model by defining the problem with equations.\\n\\n\\n### Creating the conceptual mathematical model\\n\\nA quick translation of the multi-knapsack problem with equation can be written as the following: \\n\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/equations_1.svg)\\n![screenshot-app](img/RL_images/equations_3.svg)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\nNow that we managed to translate the problem into a set of equations, let\'s translate this mathematical model so that it is understood by a computer program. Below, we will make use of the Python package [Python-MIP](https://www.python-mip.com/) which is open-source and provides tools for modeling and solving Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Problems (MIP), relying on fast open source solvers.\\n\\n### Translating the mathematical model into a computer program with Python-MIP\\n\\nBefore solving the problem, we have to generate an instance for it (have data defining the problem). To do so, you can use the following code that will generate an instance of this problem with 40 items to store in 5 bags.\\n\\n```\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport pickle\\n\\ndef data_generator_knapsack(number_bags, number_items, minimum_weight_item, maximum_weight_item, minimum_value_item, maximum_value_item, max_weight_bag):\\n    data = {}\\n    weights = np.random.randint(minimum_weight_item, maximum_weight_item, size = number_items)\\n    values = np.random.randint(minimum_value_item, maximum_value_item, size = number_items)\\n    data[\'weights\'] = weights\\n    data[\'values\'] = values\\n    data[\'items\'] = list(range(len(weights)))\\n    data[\'num_items\'] = len(weights)\\n    data[\'bins\'] = list(range(number_bags))\\n    data[\'bin_capacities\'] = np.random.randint(0, max_weight_bag, size = number_bags) + np.int(np.mean(data[\'weights\']))\\n    return(data)\\n\\nnumber_bags = 5\\nnumber_items = 40\\nminimum_weight_item = 0\\nmaximum_weight_item = 75\\nminimum_value_item = 0\\nmaximum_value_item = 75\\nmax_weight_bag = 150\\n\\ndata = data_generator_knapsack(number_bags, number_items, minimum_weight_item, maximum_weight_item, minimum_value_item, maximum_value_item, max_weight_bag)\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\nLet\'s now import the package used to have access to the MIP solver, here using the python package Python-MIP:\\n\\n```\\nfrom mip import Model, xsum, maximize, BINARY\\n```\\n\\nNow, we can translate the mathematical model so that it is understood by Python-MIP. \\n\\n```\\ndef mip_solve_knapsack(data):\\n\\n  model = Model(\\"knapsack\\")\\n\\n  x = [[model.add_var(var_type=BINARY) for i in data[\'items\']] for j in data[\'bins\']]\\n\\n  model.objective = maximize(xsum((xsum(data[\'values\'][i] * x[j][i] for i in data[\'items\']) for j in data[\'bins\'])))\\n\\n  for j in data[\'bins\']:\\n      model += xsum(data[\'weights\'][i] * x[j][i] for i in data[\'items\']) <= data[\'bin_capacities\'][j]\\n\\n  # Each item can be in at most one bin\\n  for i in data[\'items\']:\\n      model += xsum(x[j][i] for j in data[\'bins\']) <= 1\\n\\n  model.optimize()\\n  \\n  return(model)\\n```\\n\\nRemark how close it is from the original equations! These solvers are very powerful and yet easy to use directly in Python. The code is indeed very close to the original equations. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Solving the mathematical model with Python-MIP\\n\\nUsing the **mip_solve_knapsack** function defined in the previous section, we can access to important information regarding the problem, such as the final objective value and the values of x<sub>ij</sub> telling us what were the best combinations of items inside knapsacks.\\n\\n\\n### Some Mathematical Optimization packages\\n\\nIn the notebook associated to this article, the package Python-MIP was used. __Python-MIP__ is free, but many other packages exist for solving optimization problems on Python (and other languages of course like Julia). For instance __OR-Tools__ from Google is a well-recognized free solver, with [detailed documentation](https://developers.google.com/optimization/introduction/overview). \\n\\nOn the other side, __Gurobi__ is a very popular commercial solution for mathematical optimization and its documentation is extremely rich, with quick introductions about [Mathematical Programming](https://www.gurobi.com/resource/modeling-basics/), [Linear Programming](https://www.gurobi.com/resource/mip-basics/) and [Mixed-Integer Programming](https://www.gurobi.com/resource/mip-basics/). Importantly, it has a [large number of modeling examples from all industry fields](https://www.gurobi.com/resource/modeling-examples-using-the-gurobi-python-api-in-jupyter-notebook/) directly available on Google Colab allowing to better grasp notions of Mathematical Modelling and to improve modeling skills to tackle all kind of optimization problems with Python. This resource can be of use even if one doesn\'t plan to use this commercial software but rather a free package such as OR-Tools.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn this article was introduced the multi-knapsack problem, an NP-complete problem, very difficult to solve when taking many items and bags. \\n\\nThe approach to solve the multi-knapsack problem relied on Python-MIP, a free optimization package using powerful MILP solvers to solve very efficiently all kinds of optimization problems.\\n\\nIn the next part of this series on the multi-knapsack problem, well studied in the field of Operations Research and at the heart of many real optimization problems, we\'ll highlight how Deep Reinforcement Learning can be used in order to solve combinatorial optimization problems such as this one.

The reason behind this is that time series, data measured over time, are omnipresent in our day-to-day life and are used in a wide range of industries. For instance, in the retail industry, forecasting is a crucial task to optimize processes and increase efficiency. Many examples can be found in the literature mainly focusing on demand forecasting [1] and sales forecasting [2].\\n\\nIn the past, retail companies have relied on traditional time series forecasting approaches based on statistics. More recently, companies and researchers have grown interest in machine learning and deep learning techniques and algorithms to predict the demand more accurately among other requirements. To evolve as a leader in data science, at Ekimetrics, we keep an eye on the state-of-the-art of time series forecasting and investigate new techniques to eventually, adopt them and improve our solutions in the long run.\\n\\nThis article will focus on our journey with __neural ordinary differential equations__ (neural ODEs) applied to time series forecasting and specifically focused on a client\u2019s use case.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Selling magazines\\n\\nBefore entering into the subject, if you have not read our article on how we use Bayesian inference to increase our predictions of magazines sales have a look at it [here](https://ekimetrics.github.io/blog/2022/06/14/bayesian_inference/). It is an interesting application of a Bayesian framework to enhance sales prediction for a publisher. Our exploration of neural ODEs focuses on the same use case.\\n\\nIn the world of newspapers and magazines, it is crucial to be able to estimate the final volume of sales for accounting and management purposes. Indeed, publishers adjust their production and distribution of issues based on these forecasts. Conventionally, the projections rely strongly on the domain expertise of the people in charge. But nowadays, with all recent advances in the field of data science and improvements with regards to data availability, publishers can leverage modern forecasting techniques to enhance their predictions.  \\n\\nThe figure below, Fig. 1, represents the cumulative sales of a magazine composed by a set of 14 different issues. Note that the data have been anonymized for confidentiality purposes. Our task is to use the observed data, including the sales curves of all historical issues and the beginning part of the current issue\u2019s curve, to predict the final sales of the current issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/neural_ode/image_1_bis.png)\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Fig. 1: Example of magazine sales curves\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n## Introduction to neural ODEs\\n\\nIn this section we provide an overview of what neural ODEs are, and what makes them so special. For the curious readers, complementary resources and blog posts that present this topic in detail, are provided at the end of this article.\\n\\nTo understand neural ODEs, we need to introduce some basic concepts on neural networks (NNs). In essence, NNs are a succession of input, hidden and output layers originally inspired by the human brain. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is one the most popular feedforward neural network due to its simplicity. By means of activation functions and linear combinations of the input data, these networks introduce non linearities and become universal approximators [3]. The equation h(t+1) = f(ht, \u03b8t), captures the evolution of the hidden layers of a MLP network with ht referring to the previous layer and \u03b8t to a parameter of the network. Without entering too much into the details, these networks are usually trained by minimizing a loss function and backpropagation, propagating the computed error, and updating the weights accordingly.\\n\\nWhat we must keep in mind here is that these networks have a limited number of layers and thus, of evaluation points. Could we achieve an infinite number of evaluation points for time continuous applications? The instinctive answer is no since we cannot have an infinite number of layers. However, we are going to review some interesting properties of residual networks (ResNet) that will help us answer this question.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/neural_ode/image_2.png)\\n\\nFig. 2: ResNet schema [4]\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nA ResNet is a neural network that has an architecture based on the pattern pictured in Fig. 2 which entails that the network follows the equation h<sub>t+1</sub> = h<sub>t</sub> + f(h<sub>t</sub>, \u03b8<sub>t</sub>). This equation might be familiar to some readers with a background in mathematics since it resembles Euler\u2019s method. In short, this method is useful to solve initial value problems, a problem modelled by an ordinary differential equation with an initial condition. Interestingly, a residual network adds hidden states between the input and the output and discretizes the continuous relationship between them, which is similar to Euler\'s method. In [5] the authors take a different approach by considering the continuous limit of each discrete layer of the network. Thus, instead of having a discrete number of layers, the progression of the hidden states is continuous, obtaining the following equation where h(t) is the value of the hidden state evaluated for some t.\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> d\u210e(\ud835\udc61)/\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc53(\u210e(\ud835\udc61), \ud835\udf03<sub>t</sub>, \ud835\udc61)\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\nThen, in a neural ODE the hidden state dynamic can be parametrized by the equation above where \ud835\udc53(\u210e(\ud835\udc61), \ud835\udf03<sub>t</sub>, \ud835\udc61) is a neural network parametrized by \ud835\udf03<sub>t</sub> at layer t. Therefore, it is possible to solve this ODE by solving its integral.\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> h(t) = \u222b f(h(t), \ud835\udf03<sub>t</sub>, t)\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nBy means of a numerical ODE method, it is possible to evaluate the network at any desired depth. And thus, it is possible to approximate functions over these hidden state dynamics by using ODE solvers such as:\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \u0177 = h(t<sub>1</sub>) = ODESolve(h(t<sub>0</sub>), t<sub>0</sub>, t<sub>1</sub>, \ud835\udf03<sub>t</sub>, f)\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, if we go back to our initial question regarding the possibility of having an infinite or quasi-infinite number of evaluation points, we can state that neural ODEs enable us to achieve that Fig. 3 illustrates this idea by comparing the vector field created by a traditional residual network and an ODE network. In essence, an ODE network defines a continuous vector field since this network can be evaluated at any depth. Whereas, on the other hand, the residual network is limited to a discrete number of layers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/neural_ode/image_3.png)\\n\\nFig. 3: Comparison between a ResNet and an ODE network vector fields transformations [5]\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nBefore moving on to the applications of neural ODEs, it is important to note the endeavor of performing backpropagation. Essentially, the more evaluation points you have in your network, the higher the number of intermediate forward passes to store. To overcome this, the authors of the original paper [5] which received the 2018 NeurIPS best paper award, introduced a mathematical trick known as the Adjoint method. We will not get into the details here, but you can dig deeper into this concept by checking the resources we have left at the end of this article.\\n\\n## Applications of neural ODEs\\n\\nThe main advantage of neural ODEs is the possibility of working with continuous-time series models. In addition, they are generally more memory efficient than other networks such as the MLP and can gain from adaptive computation since modern ODE solvers allow to monitor the level of error and adapt the evaluation strategy. For example, we can reduce accuracy for low power applications.\\n\\nAll these benefits make neural ODEs a great tool for applications dealing with continuous time systems, irregularly sampled data, and scalable and invertible normalizing flows. Besides, neural ODEs are very interesting for time series forecasting too. Basically, they can be used to fit time series and then extrapolate them. Since 2018, we have seen an increasing number of scientific papers presenting neural ODEs to deal with forecasting challenges in the energy [6] and the healthcare [7] sectors.\\n\\nComing back to our specific use case, although Fig. 1 introduced at the beginning of this article shows that applying a curve fitting model does not seem like a feasible option, we considered our sales curves as trajectories to employ neural ODE models to fit the curves and forecast the final volumes of sales. We can formulate our problem with the following equation.\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> x\u03b8<sub>t+1</sub> = x\u03b8<sub>0</sub> + \u222b b(x\u03b8<sub>u</sub>, u) du\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere x is an issue belonging to a magazine and b in our case is a neural network, something resembling to b(x\u03b8<sub>u</sub>, u) = MLP(x\u03b8<sub>u</sub>), with its corresponding parameters.\\n\\n## Results\\n\\nInitially, we have used a standard neural ODE network to deal with our time series forecasting use case. The figure below, Fig. 4, is an animation representing the fitting of a curve of sales of a specific issue. Bear in mind that the data have been anonymized for privacy purposes.\\n\\nIn this figure, we can observe that the model is able to fit the curve successfully after some iterations. The idea then is to fit the sales curves from all historical issues and the beginning part of the current issue\u2019s curve to predict the final sales by extrapolation. Although we have obtained promising results, they are not good enough. The main reason being that neural ODEs are well suited for deterministic systems and in our case, we deal with a non-deterministic one.\\n\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/neural_ode/curve_fitting.gif)\\n\\nFig. 4: Curve fitting of the sales curve of an issue\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n\\nInspired by the ideas presented in [8], instead of a standard neural ODE network like the one introduced before, we have been recently working with stochastic differential neural networks (SDEs). SDEs are a type of continous neural network enabling to introduce a stochastic component and consequently, work with non-deterministic systems and consider external factors. We have obtained promising preliminary results with this procedure, but they require further analysis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn this article, we have introduced you into the world of neural ordinary differential equations applied to time series forecasting. We have gone through a short theoretical explanation and presented you our exploration with neural ODEs to strengthen predictions for a magazine publisher.\\n\\nAt Ekimetrics, we accompany a large portfolio of clients across a wide range of industries to help them steer their data opportunity, build capabilities, and deploy actionable DS solutions to power up a sustainable growth. As a leader in the field of data science, we perform recurring technological watches and stay tuned on the state-of-the-art of the fields of machine learning and deep learning. As stated during this article, we are particularly interested in time series and investigate recent advances on the subject to eventually, embrace them and expand our solutions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## References\\n\\n[1] J.

However, pandas has inner limitations when working with large datasets. Alternatives for distributed computing exist but each of them requires us to skill up. The main barrier is the syntax required by the language which is often complex. Different packages tried to simplify the process (koalas for instance) but we want to focus ourselves on Fugue. Fugue is described as a \u201cunified interface for distributed computing that lets users execute Python, pandas, and SQL code on Spark and Dask without rewrites\u201d. Fugue does not require a lot of time to get used to it and is a good common tool for SQL users and python ones. We invite you to watch the video here under which contextualizes Fugue and provides some useful background. \\n\\n[Why Pandas-like Interfaces are Sub-optimal for Distributed Computing | by Kevin Kho | Jun, 2022 | Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-pandas-like-interfaces-are-sub-optimal-for-distributed-computing-322dacbce43)\\n\\n[Talk - Kevin Kho/Han Wang: Comparing the Different Ways to Scale Python and Pandas Code - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ae0m_XTys)\\n\\n## Machine Learning\\n\\n### In-hand NLP search tool backed by Transformers and Q&A: Haystack\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/newsletter_june_2022/Image_2.png)\\n</div>\\n\\nDeepset, a German NLP start-up, released a bit more than a year ago a powerful and simple tool: Haystack. Haystack is a comprehensive framework enabling its users to use state-of-the-art Question Answering model to browse large textual datasets. Haystack is a local and little search engine. It is meant to be used by a broad range of users (from beginners to expert). You can tailor some part of the interface and even modify back-end specificities such as the backbone model used (Bert, Roberta, Luke\u2026). \\n\\n[GitHub - deepset-ai/haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack)\\n\\n### Liquid Neural Network: Next generation model for sequential data \\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/newsletter_june_2022/Image_3.png)\\n</div>\\n\\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) demonstrated a strong performance when used for sequential data. RNN are made of complex recurrent units enabling the network to keep track of past information while new inputs are fed in. In 2018, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations appeared and were seen as a major change in how we are modelling data. Instead of modeling the true generative function of Y, we are looking to model its derivative. This article was seen as a major change in how we can shift from a discrete model state to a continuous one. \\nLiquid Time Constant Networks (LTC) were introduced in 2020 with a strong emphasis on the concept of hidden state in the model. In previous models, hidden state at time t is optimized according to the output at time t (maximizing the accuracy). In LTCs, hidden state is used both to predict the output, but also the next hidden state t+1. It means that at each time-step, you update your memory, according to what you saw, see and expect to see in the future. This application is particularly powerful when you need to generate data at a given horizon. If you want a quick deep dive in LTC you can follow the first link. The second one is the original paper that might be hard to read the in first instance.\\n\\n\\n[Liquid Neural Networks in Computer Vision | by Jacob Solawetz | Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/liquid-neural-networks-in-computer-vision-4a0f718b464e)\\n\\n[Article - Liquid Time-constant Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04439.pdf)\\n\\n## Data Engineering & Architecture\\n\\n### MongoDB vs ElasticSearch vs Redshift \\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/newsletter_june_2022/Image_4.png)\\n</div>\\n\\nDifferent tools exist when required to structure and organize a data architecture.

In this case, using a \u201cmap\u201d object is appropriate and results in a significant memory saving and computational performance improvement. \\n\\n[When You Should Prefer Map Over Object In JavaScript (zhenghao.io)](https://www.zhenghao.io/posts/object-vs-map)\\n\\n## Special Section: Yolo\u2019s creator history  \\n\\n### Jon Redmon, the poney lovers and Computer Vision boss !\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/newsletter_june_2022/Image_6.png)\\n</div>\\n\\nFor anyone who worked on Computer Vision during studies or even in professional environments, Object Detection always raises as a major challenge. The task consists in detecting in a picture multiple instances and drawing a bounding box around it. Back in 2015, the state-of-the-art architecture is a Region-based Convolutional Neural Network or RCNN (followed by different improvement called Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN\u2026). To make it brief and simple, RCNN takes Regions Of Interest (ROIs), which are little rectangle cropped from the image, fed to a Neural Network. Eventually ROIs are pooled together to produce the true bounding boxes we want. The biggest limit of R-CNN is the ROIs generation part which can take a lot of time before getting a prediction (therefore improvements of R-CNN always have a speed related word).\\n\\nJon Redmon, who at the time was in the early years of his PhD, proposed a new architecture called YOLO (You Only Look Once). The framework approaches the task of object detection as a regression problem rather than a classification one (R-CNN uses a classifier to predict bounding boxes). He also modifies the framework to get a single network that can be trained and optimized. This change of loss enables the network to be fully trainable on the whole image. The model shows exceptional performance both for real-time detection, but also in terms of accuracy. \\n\\nFollowing this breakthrough, Jon Redmon worked on several new versions of YOLO, all becoming state-of-the-art in the field. However, in early 2020, he decided to stop his research in the field of Computer Vision as he saw a rise of ethical concerns around his work (especially in the military field). \\n\\nI strongly invite you to read (at least) his resume which is by far the best one in the AI field! Check out his website to deepen your knowledge about his research. If you want, you can also check his first Yolo paper which is amazing!\\n\\n[Redmon Resume (pjreddie.com)](https://pjreddie.com/static/Redmon%20Resume.pdf)\\n\\n[Survival Strategies for the Robot Rebellion (pjreddie.com)](https://pjreddie.com/)\\n\\n[You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf)\\n\\n## Credits\\n- Cover Photo by <a href=\\"https://unsplash.com/@cristofer?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\\">Cristofer Maximilian</a> on <a href=\\"https://unsplash.com/@cristofer?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\\">Unsplash</a>\\n  \\n</div>"},{"id":"/2022/06/14/bayesian_inference","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/06/14/bayesian_inference","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-14-bayesian_inference.md","title":"Bayesian inference for better predictions of magazine sales","description":"This article describes how Ekimetrics helped major press publishers using Bayesian inference for sales prediction.","date":"2022-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 14, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Bayesian Inference","permalink":"/blog/tags/bayesian-inference"},{"label":"Digital Transformation","permalink":"/blog/tags/digital-transformation"},{"label":"Sales Prediction","permalink":"/blog/tags/sales-prediction"},{"label":"AthenIA","permalink":"/blog/tags/athen-ia"}],"readingTime":7.655,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Duong Nguyen","title":"Senior Machine Learning Consultant","url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Bayesian inference for better predictions of magazine sales","author":"Duong Nguyen","author_title":"Senior Machine Learning Consultant","author_url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com","header_image_url":"./img/blog/press_printing.jpg","tags":["Bayesian Inference","Digital Transformation","Sales Prediction","AthenIA"],"draft":false,"description":"This article describes how Ekimetrics helped major press publishers using Bayesian inference for sales prediction.","keywords":["Data Science","EkiLab","Ekimetrics","Eki.Lab","Eki","Machine Learning","Artificial Intelligence","Data Science for business","Bayesian Inference","Sales Prediction","AthenIA","Digital Transformation"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Newsletter for June 2022","permalink":"/blog/2022/07/05/newsletter_June-2022"},"nextItem":{"title":"Newsletter for April 2022","permalink":"/blog/2022/05/02/newsletter_April-2022"}},"content":"\x3c!-- import useBaseUrl from \\"@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\\";\\n\\n<link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"{useBaseUrl(\'katex/katex.min.css\')}\\" />\\n --\x3e\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/bayesian_inference/press_printing.jpg)\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n<div align =\\"justify\\">\\n\\n\\n\\nWhether it\u2019s a tabloid that we quickly grabbed on the way to work, or a magazine with a free toy that we carefully selected for our kids on the way home, print newspapers have always been an integral ingredient in many people\u2019s lives. That feeling of getting to read something fresh off the press. That powdery smell of paper. That daily reading routine to get you awake every morning. All this, however, seems to bring a sense of nostalgia to most people now. \\n\\nThe newspaper sector is facing a tough time. The rapid and inevitable shift to digital content across domains has significantly reduced the audience size of the traditional press. At the same time, production costs have become more and more expensive. Covid-19 and lockdowns are changing customer behaviour. Altogether, these factors are rendering the industry\u2019s current distribution strategies obsolete. \\n\\nMore than ever, the industry needs to adapt itself to stay in the game. Many publishers are using data and data science techniques such as demand forecasting, sales prediction, supply optimization, and management dashboard to assist their business decisions.\\n\\nIn this article, we will shed a light on one of those tools: __sales prediction.__\\n\\n\\n\\n## Mobilis in Mobile (Jules Verne)\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/bayesian_inference/pen_paper.png)\\n\\nWhen a publisher sells a magazine issue, they need to estimate the total sales for accounting, financial and management purposes. For example, in accounting, the total sales are needed to calculate the estimated revenue and profit, which may later inform decision-makers to adjust the production and distribution of the next issues. Traditionally, the predictions are based on the domain expertise of the people in charge. However, with data becoming more and more available, we can leverage recent advances in machine learning to improve our predictions.\\n\\n\\nFig. 1 shows the cumulative sales of a magazine (the data have been anonymized for confidential purposes). The objective is to use the observed data, including the sales curves of all historical issues and the beginning part of the current issue\u2019s curve, to predict the final sales.  \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/bayesian_inference/sales_curves_3.png)\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Fig. 1: Example of magazine sales curves\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\nAs we can see from the figure, there is a high variability in the sales curves. Averaging the sales of historical issues does not provide a good prediction of the current issue. Naively applying a curve fitting model does not seem like a feasible option either. Furthermore, we do not have that much data to train a data-hungry model such as deep neural network. \\n\\n## Context and domain expertise are crucial!\\n\\nIn the real world, the sales of a magazine issue depends on several factors, such as the content and the cover of the issue (e.g. the better the content and the covers are, the more sales), the season (e.g. some magazine may sell better in summer), the holidays during the sale period (e.g. people may buy a magazine at the train station when they go on vacations). A good prediction model needs to consider those factors to be able to make precise forecasts.\\n\\nThere are two big questions: *which factors to take into account and how to encode them?*\\n\\nTo answer the first question, we need the insights of domain experts. They have been working in the industry for many years. More than anyone else, they understand their magazines, the market and customer behaviour. That knowledge is invaluable!\\n\\nFor the second question, there is a mathematical framework that allows us to incorporate the prior knowledge (provided by the domain experts and extracted from the data of historical issues) and the observations (the daily reported sales of the current issue) to make a better prediction: __Bayesian inference__. \\n\\n## Bayesian inference as a mathematical tool to combine the prior expectation and the new observed evidence\\n \\n![screenshot-app](img/bayesian_inference/bayesian_inference.png)\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Fig. 2: Bayesian inference\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\nWith the insights provided by domain experts and extracted from the historical data, we can estimate an expectation of the sales of the current issue, prior to its sale period. However, even though the experts have a deep understanding of the product as well as the market, and the historical data may show some characteristics of the sales curves, there is always a grey zone of uncertainty and error. The market evolves; customers change their buying habits; some internal factors were poorly estimated; some external factors were not considered; some unexpected events happen during the sale period, etc. All those factors make the prediction which is purely based on historical experiences less reliable. \\n\\nAfter the sale of the current issue has taken place, we can cumulate the recorded sales to get the beginning part of its sales curve. The more time passes, the more observations are built up. Those observations provide the latest information of the reality and indicate how the real sales actually evolve. However, the observations themselves contain noise. For example, a point of sale may forget to record a sale or record it a few days late, preventing us from using purely the observations to make a precise prediction.\\n\\nSince we do not have enough subjective data, we can leverage Bayesian inference to fold in the prior knowledge that we have already had (thanks to the inputs of the experts and the historical sales) to draw stronger and sharper predictions. Mathematically, we model the sales by a random variable X that follows a distribution p(X|\u03b8) parameterised by a set of parameters \u03b8: X ~ p(X|\u03b8). The prediction problem is reduced to finding the \u201ccorrect\u201d \u03b8. Given the observations X<sub>obs</sub> (the sales records at the beginning of the sale period of the current issue in our case), frequentist approaches such as the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method find an optimal \u03b8 that best fits Xobs: \u03b8<sub>MLE</sub> = argmax<sub>\u03b8</sub>(p(X<sub>obs</sub>|\u03b8)), then plug it in to make the sales prediction: X<sup>pred</sup><sub>MLE</sub> = argmax<sub>X</sub>(p(X|\u03b8<sub>MLE</sub>)). However, X<sub>obs</sub> usually contain noise,  results in a bad estimation of \u03b8. With Bayesian inference, we can integrate our prior knowledge to get better predictions. Specifically, from the sales of historical issues and the inputs of the experts, we have an idea of how \u03b8 should be, modelled as the prior distribution p(\u03b8). Incorporating it with the information provided by the observations Xobs, we get the posterior distribution p(\u03b8|X<sub>obs</sub>), which is proportional to the prior p(\u03b8) and the likelihood p(X<sub>obs</sub>|\u03b8) (see Fig. 2): \\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> p(\u03b8|X<sub>obs</sub>) \u221d p(X<sub>obs</sub>|\u03b8)*p(\u03b8)\\n\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\nIn Bayesian inference, rather than predicting a single value of the sales, we predict its distribution, called the posterior predictive distribution:\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">p(X<sup>pred</sup><sub>Bayesian</sub>|X<sub>obs</sub>) = \u222bp(X<sup>pred</sup><sub>Bayesian</sub>|\u03b8)*p(\u03b8|X<sub>obs</sub>)d\u03b8\\n\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n\\nBy doing so, we take into account the uncertainty in the prior, as well as the fact that the observations are noisy. \\n\\n A pipeline\u2014implemented in Spark and PyMC3\u2014of the whole process, is depicted in Fig. 3. At the beginning, based on an analysis of the the characteristics of the issues and the market, the historical sales and the inputs of the experts, we estimate the prior p(\u03b8). During the sale period, this estimation will be regularly revised, updated and adjusted in light of the observations X<sub>obs</sub> to get the posterior  p(\u03b8|X<sub>obs</sub>), which is used to calculate the posterior predictive p(X<sup>\u03b8pred</sup><sub>Bayesian</sub>|X<sub>obs</sub>).   The posterior predictive is then formatted and sent to the decision-makers. \\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/bayesian_inference/pred_pip.png)\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Fig. 3: Bayesian sales prediction pipeline\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n## Results\\n\\nFig. 4 shows an example of the prediction at day 30 of the sale period. We compare the performance of the Bayesian model with that of a frequentist baseline (in this example, is a logarithmic curve fitting model). Both the models are fed with the sales curves of historical issues and the sales records of the first 30 days of the current issue\u2019s sale. Additionally, the Bayesian model has the characteristics of the issues (cover, number of holidays during the sale period, etc.) as well as the opinions of the experts on the similarity between the current issue and some issues in the past. The objective is to predict  the sales of the rest 30 days. \\n\\nWe can observe that the prediction of the frequentist model is too optimistic because of the (false) positive signals during the first half of the sale period. By contrast, the 95% HDI (highest density interval) of the Bayesian prediction well covers the true sales. This is thanks to the prior insights that the Bayesian model has been given.  \\n\\n\\n![screenshot-app](img/bayesian_inference/sales_pred.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Fig. 4: Example of the sales predictions of a magazine at day 30\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWe have walked through an example of how to make better predictions of magazine sales. Data and data science have revolutionized many domains. However, to make the most out of digital assets, a hand-in-hand collaboration between data scientists and business experts is much needed. \\n\\nSince 2018, Ekimetrics has been accompanying press publishers in their digital transformation journey.

However, Gradio is made to share pre-trained models meaning that it cannot be used as an Active Learning asset where data would be provided to the model iteratively to its training.

Continual Learning means to train a single model on various type of tasks iteratively. When being trained at step t, the model does not have access to previous data. One of the main challenge posed by such concept is how to maintain knowledge from past data into the model, avoiding catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, researchers propose an approach by leveraging prompt engineering. Using prompt Is very common in NLP as it tends to better fine-tune pretrained algorithms. The main idea of this paper is to tackle continual learning not as a model weights\u2019 shift but rather as a memory space representing the type of task to be trained on. \\n\\n[Learning to Prompt for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08654)\\n\\n## Data Engineering & Architecture\\n\\n### Putting ElasticSearch into production \\n\\n![](img/newsletter_april_2022/ElasticSearch.jpg)\\n\\nElasticSearch is a famous distributed search engine build on Apache Lucene.

It contains all the instructions to produce & reproduce it identically everywhere it will be run: on another laptop, maybe with a different OS, in the cloud.\\n\\nSome quick definitions:\\n* The Docker image is the result of the build of the Dockerfile.\\n* The Docker container is the result of running the image.\\n* You can pull and push images to a container registry.\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![Docker definitions schema](./img/docker-definitions-schema.gif)\\n</div>\\n\\n#### Choosing the base image\\nIt always starts with a **FROM** instruction that defines what is the base image which can be either:\\n* a linux-based OS: [ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/layers/ubuntu/library/ubuntu/latest/images/sha256-31cd7bbfd36421dfd338bceb36d803b3663c1bfa87dfe6af7ba764b5bf34de05?context=explore), [debian](https://hub.docker.com/layers/debian/library/debian/stable/images/sha256-7ec7bef742f919f7cc88f41b598ceeb6b74bcb446e9ce1d2d7c31eb26ccba624?context=explore), [centos](https://hub.docker.com/layers/centos/library/centos/latest/images/sha256-a1801b843b1bfaf77c501e7a6d3f709401a1e0c83863037fa3aab063a7fdb9dc?context=explore)...\\n* an OS with preinstalled tools: [python-3.8](https://hub.docker.com/layers/python/library/python/3.8/images/sha256-71d10e809efb1733e2743fb7be3417db18070e10a2276e727216f245f7418592?context=explore), [mongo-5.0.7](https://hub.docker.com/layers/mongo/library/mongo/5.0.7/images/sha256-5b5263a7d25d06d5149904eaaacdb359edcd4f26a3d971265f85362dd2406655?context=explore), [node-17.9.0](https://hub.docker.com/layers/node/library/node/17.9.0/images/sha256-c1336669570df673e44d5a2152eb4eff99f4c23bb3d19361c69f861b1bd5ffd3?context=explore)\\n* a ready-to-use image of a project like the [Docker Tutorial](https://hub.docker.com/r/docker/getting-started).\\n\\nChoosing your base image is important as it can help you reduce the amount of steps to get ready. If you chose Ubuntu as your base image for a Python project, you will need to write the instructions to install the Python version you want to install and your image will also come with many other packages that are preinstalled in the OS that you may not need for your projet. This is why Python images are available. It comes with Python already installed and some images (like slim images) also remove packages that aren\'t necessary for Python development. This strongly impacts the size of your image as shown here:\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![Python Docker images size comparison](./img/python-docker-images-size-comparison.png)\\n</div>\\n\\nThese are official Docker images and depending on which version you pull, you can see the size difference is quite noticeable.\\n* python\xa03.8 is almost 1GB.\\n* python 3.8-slim reduces it by 86%.\\n* python 3.8-alpine even goes down to <50MB.\\n\\nAlpine is not recommended for Python development as standard PyPi wheels don\'t work on Alpine and you have to compile them for every package, which can lead to additional research to properly achieve it. In some instances, compiling can also be very lengthy, like matplotlib that takes more than 25min to build:\\n\\n![matplotlib-build-alpine](./img/python-matplotlib.png)\\n\\nNobody ain\'t got time for that. \\n\\n### Efficient Build Instructions\\n\\nSo let\'s build our image using a small, ready-to-python image like ```python:3.8-slim```. We first need to install all our app requirements. So we add our ```requirements.txt``` file and install just like we would do locally :\\n\\n\\n``` Dockerfile\\nFROM python:3.8-slim\\n\\n# We place ourself in a dedicated folder\\nWORKDIR /app\\n# Installing requirements\\nADD ./requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt\\nRUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir\\n```\\n\\nAdding the file alone and installing the requirements right after allows you to create a layer that will be cached and you will not have to reuse this step in a future build. It is generally a good practice to use the cache when in development mode as you don\'t want to spend 10 minutes at every build of your requirements (you know it can take a while). The way Docker cache works is that by default it will reuse the highest unmodified layers.\\n\\n![docker-cache-example](./img/docker-cache-example.gif)\\n\\nHere are the commands that generate a layer and which you want to be able to cache and/or gather in a single instruction.\\n\\n* **FROM** creates a layer from the base image.\\n* **COPY** adds files from your Docker client\u2019s current directory.\\n* **RUN** builds your application with make.\\n* **CMD** specifies what command to run within the container.\\n  \\n[Source](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/)\\n\\nThen, we add the different required files with the *ADD* or *COPY* instructions. In our example, we need the python main code, the data and one image.\\n``` Dockerfile\\nADD streamlit_app.py  uber-raw-data-sep14.csv.gz  uber_demo.png /app/\\n```\\nTo access the app, we need to open port 8051 on the container. Otherwise, even if the app is running, it will not be accessible from outside the container by a browser. Instruction is :\\n\\n``` Dockerfile\\nEXPOSE 8051\\n```\\n\\nThe last instruction is the *RUN*, which tells Docker which command needs to be run at the start of the container. For us, it means starting the Streamlit app with the command ```streamlit run /index.py```, which in Docker syntax is:\\n\\n``` Dockerfile\\nCMD [\\"streamlit\\", \\"run\\" ,\\"/index.py\\"]\\n```\\n\\nThe final Dockerfile should look like this:\\n``` Dockerfile title=\\"Dockerfile\\"\\nFROM python:3.8-slim\\n\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\nEXPOSE 8501\\n\\nADD requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt\\nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt\\n\\nADD streamlit_app.py  uber-raw-data-sep14.csv.gz  uber_demo.png /app/\\n\\nCMD [\\"streamlit\\",\\"run\\",\\"streamlit_app.py\\"]\\n```\\n#### Run your Streamlit container\\nTo build your image, just run the command:\\n\\n``` bash\\ndocker build --tag ekilab-demo-container .\\n```\\n\\nOnce built, you can run the container with the command:\\n\\n``` bash  \\ndocker run -dp 8501:8501 ekilab-demo-container\\n```\\n\\nYour app should now be running and available at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).\\n\\n#### Live Reload\\n\\nThe issue with the current setup is that if you make a change to your app, you will need to rebuild and re-run the container to see the changes in your browser. We don\'t want to rebuild the whole environment, and to do that we will use the [volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) feature of Docker, and make it easy with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).\\nDocker-compose is a powerful tool to orchestrate multiple containers. But in our case, we will only use it to make our life easier. \\n \\n\\n```yml title=\\"docker-compose.yml\\"\\nversion: \\"3.9\\"\\nservices:\\n  ekilab-demo-container: \\n    build: .\\n    ports:\\n      - \\"8501:8501\\"\\n    volumes:\\n      - ./:/app \\n```\\nNow, you only need to remember one single command: ```docker compose up```. It will build your image, run it with the correct parameters and link it to the correct volume.\\n## Ship it to the Cloud !\\nIf you don\'t have an Azure account, you can create one for [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) and get 200$ of credits for trying out the platform. \\n\\n### Log into Azure\\n\\nLog into your account using the Azure CLI with the ```az login``` command.\\nThen, we will need a container registry. At Ekimetrics, we usually build our infrastructure using an Infrastructure-As-Code tool such as [Terraform](https://terraform.io). But for the sake of simplicity, let\'s use simple CLI\xa0commands to create our resources.\\n\\n### Container registry \\nThe container registry will store the different versions of our container. It can also be used to store other images. You can consider it as your private DockerHub.\\n\\n``` bash\\naz acr create --name ekilabhub --resource-group ekimetrics-demo --sku basic --admin-enabled true\\n```\\n### Linux App Service Plan\\nTo run our app, we need a Linux-based resource. This is what the App Service Plan offers.\\nB1 is a free instance that you can use for your small apps and Proof Of Concept.\\n\\n``` bash\\naz appservice plan create --resource-group ekimetrics-demo -n ekimetrics-lasp -l westeurope --is-linux --sku B1\\n```\\n\\nNow, we have several options :\\n* Option 1 - build the image locally and push it to the container registry\\n* Option 2 - build the image directly from the registry\\n* Option 3 - build and push the image from a CI/CD pipeline\\n\\nLet\'s try :\\n``` bash\\n# log into the container registry\\ndocker login ekilabhub.azurecr.io --username ekilabhub --password its4secr\u20act!\\n\\n# Option 1 - push the new Docker image to the registry\\ndocker push ekilabhub.azurecr.io/ekilab/ekilab-demo-container:latest\\n\\n# Option 2 - directly build on Azure Container Registry\\naz acr build --registry ekilabhub --resource-group ekimetrics-demo-rg --image ekilab-demo-container .\\n```\\n\\n### The Web App\\nFinally we can create the web app, based on our previously created App Service Plan, and by retrieving the image from the Container Registry.\\n\\n``` bash\\naz webapp create --resource-group ekimetrics-demo-rg -p ekimetrics-lasp -n ekilab-demo-app -i ekilabhub.azurecr.io/ekilab/ekilab-demo-container:latest\\n```\\n\\n## Let\'s Automate!\\nIt\'s all been fun but we don\'t want to do this every time we update the code. It would be easy to make a mistake and you may want to collaborate with other Data Scientists on your team and have their updates deployed without your help!\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![automate-all-the-things](./img/automate.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n### Bitbucket Pipelines\\nIn this example we are using [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://bitbucket.org/product/fr/features/pipelines) to automate these deployment steps but the logic is very similar in other tools such as [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/), [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build), [Gitlab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/introduction/), [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)...\\n\\nThe common concept behind these tools is to store all the instructions in a YAML file and execute them at every commit to a given branch. In our example, the master branch gathers the code that will be delivered to production.\\n\\n\\n```yml title=\\"bitbucket-pipelines.yml\\"\\nimage: python:3.8\\n\\npipelines:\\n  branches:\\n    master:\\n\\n      - step:\\n          name: Build and Push the image         \\n          services:\\n          - docker\\n          script: \\n          # build the image\\n          - docker build -t ekilabhub.azurecr.io/ekilab/ekilab-demo-container:$BITBUCKET_BUILD_NUMBER .\\n\\n          # authenticate with the Azure Container Registry \\n          - docker login ekilabhub.azurecr.io --username ekilabhub --password  $AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD\\n\\n          # push the new Docker image to the registry\\n          - docker push ekilabhub.azurecr.io/ekilab/ekilab-demo-container:$BITBUCKET_BUILD_NUMBER\\n      \\n\\n      - step:\\n          name: Deploying App to Azure\\n          script:\\n          # Install the Azure CLI\\n          - curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | bash \\n          \\n          # login with a Service Principal / store the credentials in a secured area\\n          - az login --service-principal --username $AZURE_APP_ID --password $AZURE_PASSWORD --tenant $AZURE_TENANT_ID \\n\\n          # Set the correct image version to the web app \\n          - az webapp config container set  --resource-group $AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP  --name ekilab-demo-app  --docker-custom-image-name ekilab-demo-container:$BITBUCKET_BUILD_NUMBER  --docker-registry-server-url ekilabhub.azurecr.io --docker-registry-server-user ekilabhub --docker-registry-server-password $AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD\\n\\n```\\n\\n## What\'s next ?\\n**Congratulations !** You should now be able to automate the deployment of your app to the cloud and focus only on updating its content without worrying about how to publish your updates. Now, you might need to have a scalable app to ensure it can handle high loads of visits. You could require tools like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/).\\n\\n### Alternatives\\nWe presented one of the workflow we are using at Ekimetrics, but it\'s not the only one !

While we witness a spread of AI in many operational business areas, it is still not considered as a usable tool for C-executives. The article pictures the current environment to eventually give some key elements to deploy such technologies at this level of management. Deploying ML or even simple data science solutions at this level of responsibility requires us to do a deep check of the possible consequences as a tiny mistake can turn into a major negative outcome.

While being technical, the key takeaway of this paper is the level of generality that we get for every domain: Perceivers perform well on texts, sounds, images on a wide variety of tasks with the same underlying mechanism. In addition, it is able to scale well on high dimensional data as it bypasses the quadratic comuting time required by a Transformer.

In order to make sure you control what people see and when they have access to it, development teams use environments to create \u201cstages\u201d of the app which they consider good for releasing.\\n\\nEach environment has its own unique purpose. There are different naming standards across the industry, although almost every process starts with a \'development\' stage and ends with a \'production\' stage. Here is a typical set of environments:\\n\\n- __Development environment__ : where data scientist/data engineers/software engineers actually develop the product. The end user doesn\u2019t have access to this environment which allows developers to try new features freely. \\n\\n- __QA environment / Testing environment__ : once a product is sufficiently mature to be tested, it is deployed to a new environment in order for testers to work on a stable version, while allowing developers to continue working in the development environment at the same time. The end user doesn\u2019t have access to this environment\\n\\n- __Production environment__ : where the product will be deployed after testing and made accessible to the end client. Every features should work when the product reaches this stage.\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/1_pbi.png)\\n</div>\\n\\nFurthermore, each environment should have its own database because in the same way that products evolve through development, databases also evolve: tables may be modified, added or deleted. Thus, the actual development process actually looks like this:\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/2_pbi.png)\\n</div>\\n\\nNow that you know __why__ you should use different environments when developing products, this article explains __how__ to do that in Power BI! \\n\\n\\n:::info  \\nIn Power BI, the product you are developing is a __Report__ and the environments are __Workspaces__\\n:::\\n\\n:::note Disclaimer  \\n- This guide supposes you have already developed a Power BI report using [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/) and published this report to a Power BI Workspace, accessible through the [Power BI Web Portal](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/fr-fr/). \\n- These assumptions will be stated again at the beginning of each Part, in Step 0 - (Baseline).\\n:::\\n\\n\\n## In Power BI Desktop, make your data sources dynamic\\n\\n### Step 0 - (Baseline) Have a Power BI report connected to hard-coded data sources\\n\\n\\nAs explained in the disclaimer, you should already have a report connected to data sources. Check out this documentation for more information about [data sources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-quickstart-connect-to-data) in [Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-data-sources). \\n\\nA typical report would have several tables in the pane Fields: \\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/3_pbi.png)\\n</div>\\n\\nAs a little foreshadowing and making sure we are on the same page, open the Power Query editor (by clicking _Home_ (Top Ribbon) \u2192 _Transform Data_ \u2192 _Transform Data_; then _Advanced Editor_) for one of your tables, and notice that all your data sourcing informations are hard-coded.\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/4_pbi.png)\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/5_pbi.png)\\n\\n\\nIn the last picture, we have the following information hard-coded:\\n\\n- The server is: dev-sql-01.database.windows.net\\n\\n- The database is: dev-db-01\\n\\n- The schema is: dev-rfd-crm\\n\\nThis hard-coded information is problematic as when we publish the report from one workspace to the next, the datasource will not change: we will always get our information from \u201cdev\u201d. What we need are parameters that change automatically as we change workspaces.\\n\\n### Step 1- Creating Parameters inside your reports\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the Power Query Editor, click the _Manage Parameters_ (top ribbon under the Home tab) \u2192 _New Parameter_. (Or you can click _Manage Parameters_ and select the _New_ button on the top to create a parameter). You can fill in this form and select OK to create a new parameter.\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/6_pbi.png)\\n</div>\\n\\nYou should create parameters for every variable that needs to change as you change workspaces. In my case, I needed to create 5 parameters:\\n\\n- One server parameter\\n\\n- One database parameter\\n\\n- Two schema parameters\\n\\n- One parameter called \u201cenv\u201d (with simply the options \u2018dev\u2019, \u2018ppd\u2019 and \u2018prd\')\\n\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/7_pbi.png)\\n\\n\\n### Step 2- Using the \u2018Advanced Editor\u2019 to use the parameters when connecting to your data source\\n\\nNow that you have created your parameters, use the following syntax to refer to your parameters when connecting to your datasource. \\n\\n```\\n#\\"ParameterName\\"\\n```\\n\\nHere is what the difference looks like for me. When the data sources variables are hard coded:\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/8_pbi.png)\\n\\nWhen the data sources variables use parameters:\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/9_pbi.png)\\n\\n:::note You made it through Part 1!\\nYou now know how to make your data sources dynamic inside your reports, you implemented it and pushed your report to your workspace.  \\n\\nAnd know you ask yourself: \u201c_But now, how can I make multiple workspaces and how do I change my report parameters automatically as I publish my report between workspaces?_\u201d \\n\\nCheck out Part 2 for the answer ! \\n:::\\n\\n## Part 2: In the Power BI Web Portal, create a deployment pipeline and assign parameters to each workspace\\n\\nIn order to use parameters, we will leverage Power BI\u2019s Deployment Pipeline feature. I encourage you to read Microsoft\u2019s official documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/deployment-pipelines-get-started) if you encounter any issues when working with Deployment pipelines as it is fairly comprehensive. \\n\\n### Step 0 - (Baseline) Have your Power BI report already published to a Workspace\\n\\nCheck out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0L1uXfefms) if you haven\u2019t already published your report to a Power BI Workspace (don\u2019t hesitate to watch at speed x1.75 :wink: ) .\\n\\n### Step 1- Creating a Deployment Pipeline from your Workspace\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/10_pbi.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n### Step 2- Deploy your report from the Power BI Development Workspace to the Power BI Test Workspace\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/11_pbi.png)\\n\\n### Step 3- Modify the Deployment Parameters to use the correct parameters\\n\\n- In the pipeline stage you want to create a dataset rule for, select __Deployment settings__.\\n\\n- From the Deployment settings pane, select the dataset you want to create a rule for.\\n\\n- Select __Parameter rules__, expand the list, and then select __Add rule__.\\n\\n- Select a parameter from the list of parameters; the current value is shown. Edit the value to the value you want to take effect after each deployment.\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/12_pbi.png)\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/13_pbi.png)\\n\\n![](img/power_bi_environments/14_pbi.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n:::note  \\nNotice on the bottom of the last screenshot the following mention: \u201c_Rules will be applied when you deploy to this stage_\u201d.\\n\\nThus: once you have set the deployment settings for your report, you need to redeploy your report immediately to this workspace because the rules haven\u2019t been applied yet :sweat_smile: .  \\n:::\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nSo this is how to use different environments in Power BI in a nutshell. We went from one workspace with a hard-coded data source, to three separate workspaces where when a report is pushed from one workspace to an other, its data source changes automatically! \\n\\nDefinitely a lot of moving pieces here, but understanding theses concepts will make your workflow easier and less error-prone in the long-run ! \\n\\nI hope this information can help you on your Power BI journey!"},{"id":"/2022/02/28/newsletter_Feb-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/02/28/newsletter_Feb-2022","source":"@site/blog/2022-02-28-newsletter_Feb-2022.md","title":"Newsletter for February 2022","description":"Ekimetrics is pleased to release its second Newsletter of 2022!

It has challenged companies\' Supply Chain operations and highlighted that most companies could improve their supply chain management. Therefore, generating demand for enhanced forecasting capabilities.\\n\\nIn 2021, we had the opportunity to work with a French pioneer in manufacturing on this topic. We had to industrialize a solution for warehouse demand forecasting for more than 20,000 referenced products to improve overall Supply Chain performance. At the time, the existing solution was deprecated and not handling correctly erratic sales. \\n\\nTherefore, we had to create a new, more robust algorithm to help Operational Managers better allocate resources. This latter solution enabled a 60% accuracy improvement and was integrated into Operational Managers processes for decision making.\\n\\n\\n## An important asset for Supply Chain transformation\\n\\nDemand forecasting has an impact on different levers:\\n\\n- *Stock Management*: forecasting can drastically improve Inventory Management. Underproducing means losing revenue opportunities, whilst overproducing means selling your products cheaper or facing additional storage costs. Furthermore, with the return of activity after the first lockdown, suppliers are now bearing the brunt of building sites recovery, causing delays and creating supply instability.\\n\\n- *Resource allocation*: defining the best number of weekly working hours is not an easy task for operational managers, and anticipation is key to achieving optimal throughput.\\n\\n- *Product strategy*: demand forecasting also supports better handling of specific trends and product lifecycle. Hence, it helps warehouses anticipate and meet high demands, detect declined products and help marketing teams better understand customers\u2019 needs.\\n\\nMost importantly, Demand Forecasting has not become a hot topic because of the pandemic. Nevertheless, it brought to light the need of transforming Supply Chains and adapt to unexpected events. Indeed, global warming is increasing the frequency of natural disasters, which will test Supply Chains resilience (*have you heard of our AI4S offer?*).\\n\\n## How to build Demand Forecasting tool\\n\\n### What are we trying to solve?\\n\\nFraming the problem is key to ensuring Data Scientists go in the right direction. When discussing with Supply Chain managers, we understood they wanted to reduce their costs. Thus, improving resource allocation was the best lever to achieve their need. Clearly stating the business need allowed us to understand the problem and impacted the solution implementation.\\n\\n![Business Problem](img/article_supply/img1_v2.png)\\n\\n### Build and assess model\\n\\nBecause of the high number of products and their associated nomenclature, we used a decision tree algorithm (LightGBM). The business required a reliable mid-term forecasting tool within a short time lap and with limited team size, justifying the choice of a well-known and high-performance algorithm. Our solution is a 3-week forecasting tool with daily updates for all referenced products.\\n\\nThe ML pipeline we have built for this project is similar to many existing ones. Therefore, we will focus on how the business problem framed our solution. Still, this project was an opportunity for us to use [Kedro](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), which enabled Data Science teams to set up their ML data pipelines. Kedro had the advantage of visualizing your pipeline and structuring our code to ensure maintainability and reproducibility.\\n\\n![Kedro Pipeline](img/article_supply/kedro_2.png)\\n\\n\\n#### Modelling target\\n\\nWe want to optimize warehouse working hours to ensure clients satisfaction by delivering stores on time.\\n\\nWhat requires the most operational effort? Our client uses single order picking methods - meaning that pickers work on one order at a time. Thus, it is more time-consuming for a picker to prepare two orders of the same product rather than picking two times the product for the same order. Consequently, we focused on predicting the number of orders rather than the quantity ordered.\\n\\nNB: depending on how your supply chain operates, the modelling output would differ.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Modelling granularity\\n\\nOur client had a complex product hierarchy, meaning products can be aggregated at different levels. Demand forecasting at a product level gives higher flexibility when used on various business use cases, albeit not being the optimal solution for each one. Therefore, we aggregated ordered products at a higher granularity, to find the best balance between modelling accuracy and business need.\\n\\nWorking at a product level when having more than 20,000 products can be painful:\\n\\n- it means working with sparse time series (which isn\u2019t trivial when using decision trees)\\n\\n- manufacturing companies often deal with products turnover (because products are frequently improved), meaning you may lose the thread of which product is getting improved.\\n\\nTherefore, to optimize resource allocation, it was relevant to build a forecasting tool at a product category level, to combine similar products and avoid dealing with product\u2019s turnover. Analyzing sparsity at different granularities also helped us define the best modelling level.\\n\\n![Histogram](img/article_supply/img3.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Distribution of products\' sparsity (e.g. percentage of zeroes in orders). It is clear that most products have more than 90% of zeroes. \\n </div>\\n <br/>\\n\\nImportant learnings here were:\\n\\n1. Sparse time series are hard to predict\\n2. **It is best to go for a solution where the unit (time x product x localization) of forecasting matches the unit of decision making**\\n\\n![Predictions](img/article_supply/img4.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> We see how the coronavirus outbreak impacted the activity of our client during the first containment. Predicting this period is pretentious, but how can it help us reduce uncertainty in the future?\\n </div>\\n <br/>\\n\\n#### Modelling loss function\\n\\nModelling errors assess algorithms performance and help choose the model we will industrialize to better impact operations. However, when deploying a solution, we want to measure an error that reflects the current problem. Demand forecasting is not exclusively about being accurate on future demands but also about improving operations. Therefore, customizing errors metrics is a key part of machine learning development, allowing us to define the right balance between product demand (model accuracy) and product average preparation time. (focus on products with high preparation time).\\n\\nWe implemented the Weighted Root Mean Squared Scaled Error, using product average revenues in the last 6 months and product average preparation time.\\n\\n\\n![Prep Time](img/article_supply/table_2_v2.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Product B weekly preparation time is 400 min vs 200 min for Product A. Thus, higher accuracy on Product B is needed to reflect the operational needs.\\n </div>\\n <br/>\\n\\n### Evaluate business outcome\\n\\nBecause predictions are not always (never) linked to business outcomes, it is important to differentiate outputs (what are the predictions?) from outcomes (how will it impact the business?). This part was not implemented during the project, but we will briefly explain the methodology to give you a flavour on how it could be done.\\n\\nModel accuracy is a technical metric, so to quantify our ML model impact on operations we also need to estimate the predicted number of working hours. Comparing the number of predicted working hours with the realized working hours would allow measuring how much the algorithm is reducing costs.\\n\\n## Create a sustainable solution\\n\\n\\n### Implement a web app\\n\\nA core part of our solution was to implement an easy-to-use application for operations managers. It helped them access predictions in real-time, assess model past performance and define the optimal working hours needed. We used Streamlit for its ease of use and ability to create fast and intuitive applications whenever we are short on time. Consequently, we created a usable solution by communicating predictions, demand, and past errors at different granularities.\\n\\n### Add a feedback loop\\n\\nFinally, we created a feedback loop to enable the team to maintain, improve and sustain the solution. This concept is well explained in *Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence*, a book about what AI means from an economist perspective. They introduce a great concept they have named the Anatomy of a Task.\\n\\n![Anatomy of a Task](img/article_supply/img5_v3.png)\\n\\n\\nPredictions mainly impact people\u2019s judgement and decisions taken for action. It implies that algorithms are rather helpful for decision-makers than make the actual choice. In our situation, the predictions enable operational managers to take action on the number of pickers needed in the coming weeks. Improving modelling should help these managers be more accurate in their decision process. Giving Data Science teams feedback on how modelling affected outcomes is the added value.\\n\\nConsequently, we decided to create a clear feedback process with the operational managers. We made sure we could improve our forecasting model in a business manner rather than a statistical one. Our model not being perfect, the operational team\u2019s feedback on how our predictions are impacting their daily work will help us improve our algorithms and create a sustainable solution.\\n\\n\\n## Concluding and food for thought\\n\\nNew challenges will arise, and data will help supply chains tackle them. Creating a data-driven culture is key to useful and sustainable solutions. Creating state-of-the-art models is great, but a successful data science transformation is about creating impactful projects and delivering value throughout.\\n\\nThanks to this project, we learnt that:\\n\\n- Demand Forecasting is a great entry to improve Supply Chain operations, but the impact will be limited if not embedded in the full Supply Chain environment.\\n\\n- Demand forecasting is not about predicting the future, but about how data helps improve communication between teams.\\n\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"/2022/02/09/ekimetrics_implements_data_mesh","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/02/09/ekimetrics_implements_data_mesh","source":"@site/blog/2022-02-09-ekimetrics_implements_data_mesh.md","title":"Ekimetrics implements Data Mesh.

So, while I will cherry-pick some of the data mesh ideas that we are implementing today, I strongly encourage you to read both articles thoroughly. Said differently, what I describe below is only what is closest to our mindset and to our maturity on the projects, but there are many more insights in the original papers.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n## What is data mesh?\\n\\nData Mesh is a nice way to organize and grow data assets that serve business purposes. Data Mesh takes a limited number of simple ideas for data management, and all the terms used below are described in detail in the two foundational articles:\\n\\n- Ownership of data should be within the hands of the business teams,\\n\\n- Data boundaries should be created along business boundaries for data security, data sharing, cost management, etc., these are called Data Domains,\\n\\n- Sharing datasets inside and possibly outside the company should be simple,\\n\\n- Focusing on data products is a good approach to create value from data,\\n\\n- Federated governance is an approach that will scale where other cannot,\\n\\n- There is a harmonious way for IT, Data and Business teams to collaborate around data,\\n\\n \\n\\nWe see Data Mesh as a holistic way to organize data management. And since some cloud vendors have managed services that can help organize data like that, we have been working in that direction successfully with many organizations.\\n\\n\x3c!-- ![](img/data_mesh/image-20220207-172923.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Logical architecture of data mesh approach\\n </div>\\n <br/> --\x3e\\n\\n \\n\\n## Who is data mesh for?\\n\\nWe did not identify customer profiles where data mesh would not apply, so we believe it is ubiquitous. Medium and large organizations in financial services, retail, utilities, luxury, etc., both the references we have and the references we learn about prove it applies to all kind of companies.\\n\\n \\n\\nLimits are on the capability to challenge existing data assets and existing data culture, and it is not always the right moment to change these. That said, it should be possible to gradually transition from a monolithic data lake to a data mesh, by slowly introducing data domains.\\n\\n \\n\\nAnd a consultancy firm like Ekimetrics is the right place to be to participate in these changes !\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n## What is the relationship with GCP, Synapse or Databricks?\\n\\nWe see the latest generation of platforms is indeed very aligned with what data mesh requires, and GCP BigQuery, Azure Synapse and Databricks are good candidates for Data Mesh deployments.\\n\\n \\n\\nWith GCP as an example, it is easy to separate the cost of the storage in one project and the cost of the processing in another project and it\u2019s easy to leverage the data that one part of the company has prepared into a data product that is owned by another part of the company, without copying data, which is a data mesh idea. While this has been in BigQuery for a decade now, the framework now has a name!\\n\\n \\n\\nSuch solutions can now be built with GCP, Synapse and Databricks.\\n\\n \\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIf you are interested in building Data Mesh with us, please visit our [website (careers page)](https://ekimetrics.com/careers/) or our [page on Welcome to the Jungle](https://www.welcometothejungle.com/fr/companies/ekimetrics).\\n\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"/2022/02/07/building_datalake_part_1","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/02/07/building_datalake_part_1","source":"@site/blog/2022-02-07-building_datalake_part_1.md","title":"Building a datalake - Part 1 - Usable, Useful, Used, or how to avoid dataswamp and empty shell traps","description":"In this article, learn how to create your first datalake following best practices in order to make it robust, evolutive and central to your company\'s information architecture, as well as take advantage of the opportunities it presents.","date":"2022-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 7, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Datalake","permalink":"/blog/tags/datalake"},{"label":"Data Engineering","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-engineering"},{"label":"Architecture","permalink":"/blog/tags/architecture"},{"label":"Data Governance","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-governance"},{"label":"Data Mesh","permalink":"/blog/tags/data-mesh"}],"readingTime":16.485,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Emilien BOUCAUD","url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Building a datalake - Part 1 - Usable, Useful, Used, or how to avoid dataswamp and empty shell traps","author":"Emilien BOUCAUD","author_url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com","header_image_url":"img/blog/image_overview_article_datalake_1.jpg","image":"img/blog/image_overview_article_datalake_1.jpg","tags":["Datalake","Data Engineering","Architecture","Data Governance","Data Mesh"],"draft":false,"description":"In this article, learn how to create your first datalake following best practices in order to make it robust, evolutive and central to your company\'s information architecture, as well as take advantage of the opportunities it presents.","keywords":["Data Science","EkiLab","Ekimetrics","Eki.Lab","Eki","Machine Learning","Artificial Intelligence","Data Science for business","Datalake","Data Engineering","Lakehouse","Data Architecture","Data Governance","Data Validation","Data Mesh","Azure","AWS","GCP"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Ekimetrics implements Data Mesh.

The main challenge is not to create one, but rather to do it right and avoid falling into the so-called __data swamp and empty shell traps__. In this article, we\u2019ll go through how you can create your first datalake following best practices in order to make it robust, evolutive and central to your company\u2019s information architecture, as well as take advantage of the opportunities it presents.\\n\\nIn this post, we\u2019ll be technology agnostic. The focus here is a smart architecture that will help solve functional and technical challenges, whether you\u2019re using Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, any other provider or even building & managing the infrastructure yourself.\\n\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nBefore talking about how to design a datalake, let\u2019s review what it is, why it\u2019s useful and the main aspects that will ensure its quality.\\n\\n### What is a datalake?\\n\\nA datalake is a global storage space allowing to interact with all data type: unstructured (e.g. text documents, images, videos), semi-structured (e.g. XML / JSON files), structured (e.g. SQL tables, CSV files). Data is extracted from all relevant sources, loaded into the datalake, then transformed into their use case specific target.\\n\\nA well-designed datalake is flexible and scalable, allowing it to handle the increase in data volume, velocity, and variety. Because a datalake stores raw data before transforming it, it is extremely useful for extracting potential value from the data for the future. By centralizing data sources into a global storage space, it helps data scientists and analysts explore data to generate new use cases and business insights.\\n\\n### Is building a datalake the right solution?\\n\\nThe goal shouldn\u2019t be to build a datalake for the sake of building one. A datalake is only the foundation, corner pieces in your larger data analytics and data architecture puzzle. Your goal should be to find a use case from which you can build a robust and evolutive foundation to your technical and functional architecture. Having a clear vision as to how your datalake can grow in a 2-year horizon, with new data sources and analytical use cases, is essential.\\n\\n### The data swamp and empty shell traps\\n\\nChasing the dream of a datalake that meets all current and future analytics needs or that unites all of your organization\u2019s stakeholders around a single vision is an excellent way to fall into the data swamp or empty shell traps.\\n\\nBy trying to collect all current \u2013 and future \u2013 data sources from the start, there is a risk that your datalake will become a swamp. When that\u2019s the case, due to unorganized, unvalidated or simply hard to exploit data, it can be incredibly challenging to make your datalake useable.\\n\\nYour first goal should be to analyze which high impact use cases will be used by your organization\u2019s stakeholders and target data for these specific use cases. Starting with the business needs instead of chasing a technical achievement, you can be sure that your datalake will be used and useful, instead of an empty shell: a good foundation but unable to attract your organization\u2019s stakeholders. Read more about how we can avoid missing out on business impact in [this whitepaper](https://ekimetrics.com/white-paper/data-science-industrialization-business-impact/).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## The foundation architecture\\n\\nLet us first establish the building blocks of your datalake. This foundation is the basis for logical separation of your data and use cases in the platform you\'ll be building.\\n\\nA datalake can ingest any type of data: from structured tables to unstructured files, whether ingested by batch or through streaming processes. Data will transit through four zones in sequence, from its raw form to fully processed for use cases, and from a technical to a business orientation.\\n\\n- Landing LAN : temporary zone for all sources. Once data is extracted, it transits through this zone and is dispatched into the next zone by validation mechanisms.\\n\\n- RAW (also known as bronze): data extraction pipelines will fetch data in the landing zone and validate it technically as well as functionally to make sure it is usable. This zone is the main storage component for all your data, and contains every extracted source, raw and untransformed, only with a concern for what is technically and functionally usable.\\n\\nIn landing and raw zone, data is organized logically by source: CRM, Point of Sales, WEB, etc.\\n\\n- Trusted TRD (also known as silver): in this zone, you\'ll find the output of your data pipelines. Here, data is deduplicated, cleaned, transformed, and aggregated for your target use cases. Data is organized logically by data domain (Marketing, Finance, Sales, Operations\u2026) and use case (Reporting, API exposition, AI training\u2026).\\n\\n- Refined RFD (also known as gold): this is the final zone for your data. It is the exposition layer for your use cases and is organized logically by use case.\\n\\nThese four zones are a representation of your data\'s journey through the datalake. From the refined zone, a serving layer can be added, taking shape in data marts, APIs, file exposition, etc. Your apps and users can then fetch or be sent data through this serving layer and make decisions that will give your data value.\\n\\n![](img/datalake_part_1/data_journey_through_datalake_full.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Data\u2019s journey through a datalake, from source to usage\\n </div>\\n <br/>\\n\\nYour data\u2019s journey from sources to serving layers is managed by pipelines, which are themselves managed by orchestrators. Pipelines describe how data is moved and transformed, be it with highly customized code or low code interfaces: in terms of concept, pipelines are close to ELTs (Extract, Load, Transform) mechanisms. Orchestrators are an ensemble of pipelines, defining parameters for each of them and specifying when and how they should be run: periodically, when an event triggers, using larger or smaller computing power, etc.\\n\\n:::note  \\nA sandbox storage zone and computing environment can be made available with access to some of your storage zones. That sandbox allows for exploration of data by data scientists and data analysts, motivating new use cases.\\n:::\\n\\nBased on this architecture, it all seems too simple: find a high value use case to start off the building process, then add new use cases and sources later. Following the design principles in the next section, it could in fact be that simple, all the while avoiding falling into the data swamp and empty shell traps.\\n\\n\\n## Usable and Useful through architecture and design\\n\\nWe\u2019ve gathered some best practices and design principles that work well to counteract the possibility of your datalake becoming messy or unused. We like to think of each of these best practices as serving a goal that is threefold: building a datalake that is __usable, useful, and used__ - what we refer to as our three \u201cU\u201ds. The first \u201cU\u201d is targeted towards the data swamp trap, the latter two towards the empty shell trap.\\n\\n### Usable through clear storage and pipelines architecture\\n\\nThe first step for building a usable datalake is to __make your storage and pipelines easy to comprehend__ for users as well as automated processes. Technical and functional separation for pipelines and storage is your first step in making your datalake understandable.\\n\\n- __Make it clear who does what in the datalake__. A use case is built on top of data, which needs to be collected: we\u2019ve found it best to separate data collection from its transformation from the start. Using at least different pipelines, and, better still, different scheduler resources will make understanding who (or which pipeline) is doing what much easier. One orchestrator for data collection pipelines, and other orchestrators for each data domain and use case theme \u2013 e.g. finance reporting, marketing CRM, sales exposition... This also sets up your datalake\u2019s functional architecture in a \u201cdata mesh\u201d-like manner, where __each data domain has its own identifiable perimeter__. \\n\\n![](img/datalake_part_1/pipeline_separation_full.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Separating pipelines among data domain orchestrators allows for a better understanding of who does what\\n </div>\\n <br/>\\n\\n- __Make it obvious where to find data in your storage__. We\u2019ve talked a little about Landing, Raw, Trusted and Refined data storage layers. Separating your data by source in the Raw/Bronze layer will help your users and transformation pipelines identify each dataset. Separating transformed data by use case in the Trusted and Refined layers will give a better understanding of the functional architecture behind the storage.\\n\\n- __Make it apparent which transformation or collection pipelines is responsible for which data__.\\n\\n  - Use identifiers such as date and time \u201cYYYYMMDD_HHMM\u201d for your pipelines and processes. Date and time is a great identifier for __understanding when data was transformed__ or collected. Sticking to them for your logging as well, you can make sure that monitoring your pipelines and exploring their results is as easy as possible.\\n\\n  - Inside your transformation pipelines, we\u2019ve found that using break points is highly useful. Writing a dataset\u2019s state after it\u2019s been cleaned, pre-transformed, etc\u2026 up until its final refined state will make debugging and understanding your pipelines much easier. Using names like *0_deduplicated*, *1_cleaned*, *2_calculated* to show breakpoints in your transformations allow for a better understanding of the data lineage of each use case, also helping exploration in the sandbox.\\n\\n\\n### Usable through data validation\\n\\nNow that your storage and pipelines architecture is understandable, your second goal is to __make your data usable__ so that the datalake doesn\u2019t immediately become a swamp with faulty and unchecked data.\\n\\nOne mistake to avoid is to consider that since a datalake can store any type of data, all data is good to collect, and you can figure out if it\u2019s usable and useful later. On the contrary: validating data from the get-go is essential. By having your data collection pipelines look at the structure and content of the data, you can make sure that your transformation pipelines will have a smooth time reading it down the line.\\n\\nHowever, this does not mean that you instantly delete any data that is deemed unfit for your use cases. We\u2019ve found that dispatching data into __rejected and validated subzones__ in the RAW/bronze zone is a good option:\\n\\n- A rejected subzone for any __data that will not technically fit__ your use case pipelines: faulty files with bad lines, wrong column count for structured data, corrupt zip files, bad encoding, the list goes on. Deciding which data to move to the rejected subzone ultimately depends on how it will be read by later pipelines.\\n\\n- We\u2019ve also seen cases where data needs to be __rejected for functional reasons__: data from a source can be sent to you even though you\u2019re not allowed to use it, or the data is technically readable but does not match with the sources you accept. In this instance, you can divide your rejected subzone into technical rejects and functional rejects.\\n\\n- Finally, any data that is technically and functionally usable can transit to the validated subzone. When a use case pipeline reads data, it will usually only read that data\u2019s validated zone. This not only ensures that your pipelines are robust and will not fail due to faulty or unexpected data, but it also allows for a stable data model to be built.\\n\\n\\n![](img/datalake_part_1/technical_functional_data_validation_full.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Technical and functional data validation guarantee a first level of data quality\\n </div>\\n <br/>\\n\\n\\nWhy keep rejected data, you\u2019ll ask?\\n\\nData that is technically rejected is useful for several reasons, the first one being that it is a good indicator of your sources\' quality, and allows you to communicate efficiently with your data providers. Secondly, technically invalid data at one point in time may be usable in the future, be it by adjusting your later pipelines to be able to read them or simply correcting the data as a one-shot fix.\\n\\nData that is functionally rejected is also useful, particularly in cases where it\u2019s from a source you\u2019re not sure you\u2019re allowed to collect. An additional subzone can then be a quarantine zone, where you would store data for which you need to check whether you can accept it in your use cases.\\n\\n:::note  \\nBy managing functional and technical rejections, your collection pipelines can be a powerful tool for your Data Steward and apply robust and monitorable governance at the datalake\u2019s entry point.\\n:::\\n\\n\\n![](img/datalake_part_1/datasources_to_breakpoint_full.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> From validated sources to a specific breakpoint in a run ID of a Use Case in a domain\\n </div>\\n <br/>\\n\\n\\n### Useful through a business driven design\\nWhat we mean by \u201cuseful\u201d - the second of our three \u201cU\u201ds, is that your datalake has to __serve a business use, while not limiting itself__ to the first identified use cases. This in turn means several things.\\n\\nThe first thing being the importance of starting from a business use case to then identify which data must be collected and transformed. Working from the business needs is always the winning strategy, especially for data science and datalake projects where it is easy to get lost in all the possibilities. Collecting data into your datalake is not an effortless task, especially following the aforementioned tips that help validate the data\u2019s usability, functionally and technically. Which is why the first step is to make sure that the data you collect is indeed useful to your target use case. Our article [\u201cCustomer Data Platform: Thinking Backwards is the Way to Go\u201d](https://ekimetrics.com/article-insights/customer-data-platform/) summarizes this business driven approach well.\\n\\nNow, in order to make the most of that data and not limit a source to the one and only use case, your collection pipeline should only be considering it as that: a source. This means that it is not the role of your collection pipeline to determine which data will be useful and remove all other data: delta calculation, replacing referentials, etc. is not up to the collection, but to the use case pipelines. Making the most of a datalake\u2019s scalability in storage and letting your use cases define what is useful to them in their own pipelines, you\u2019ll allow for more opportunities to use the underlying source down the line.\\n\\nOne last element to make your datalake useful is to anticipate changing functional parameters. Historical depth for your transformations, functional validation for your sources, ways to trigger custom runs\u2026 If modifying these parameters has a business or data management use, they should be included in the first iteration of your pipeline developments. In our projects, they have allowed us to be extremely flexible if a pipeline needs functional change and focus on adding new use cases and sources rather than tweaking the same pipeline over and over.\\n\\n\\n## Used through scalability of business impact\\n\\nStart small, allow it to grow : identify a single use case to automate and build your foundation architecture to host it. Using the best practices presented above you\u2019ll then be able to build on top of this robust architecture.\\n\\nThe target for your datalake\u2019s first use case should be for it to be __high impact, low time to value__. It must be the proof of value your businesses divisions need to invest more in the platform and should be an inspiration for other use cases. Once that use case is identified, along with the data it needs and a design for its transformation pipelines and exposition, you can start building it following the design principles presented above.\\n\\nThe steps below are a summary of how that first use case is built, but are also highly reproducible to build new use cases once your foundation architecture is in place.\\n\\n- Ingest a new source\\n\\n  - Technical validation: what are the rules that define whether this data is usable? Set up data structure validation and organize the source in an understandable manner.\\n\\n  - If the data source is highly likely to evolve over time, make sure that the collection and technical validation pipeline for this source is evolutive as well to anticipate future changes.\\n\\n- Build a new use case\\n\\n  - Functional validation: for this use case, what are the rules that define whether this data is useful? Once again, it is best to leave functional validation to your use case pipelines, as different use cases will have different requirements for what data they want (useful) and what they can legally use (usable).\\n\\n  - Same goes for how the data is used: delta calculation, targeting referentials, cleaning, etc\u2026 these steps should be part of your use case pipeline.\\n\\n  - Build transformations with break points inside the trusted data storage zone, up to the exposition layer (refined zone / gold), where it is fully ready to serve use cases. Which of these transformations is likely to change, and can you anticipate these changes by using simple configurable parameters?\\n\\n\\n![](img/datalake_part_1/data_storage_architecture_full.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> This data storage architecture makes it easy to add new sources and use cases\\n </div>\\n <br/>\\n\\n\\nThese first two steps will show your datalake\u2019s versatility. It is able to ingest any type of data, from unstructured to structured, streaming or batch. It is also able to transform it efficiently to feed use cases, due to the scalability of its computing power.\\n\\n- Build a new serving layer\\n\\n  - This final step will vary the most between use cases, as depending on your user endpoint, there might not be a unified way to serve refined data.\\n\\n  - Here you may need additional resources on top of your foundation architecture: an API management service, a database to efficiently serve structured data, a web service or container to display interfaces\u2026\\n\\nThat\u2019s it, your use case is fully functional on your datalake. Using the best practices we\u2019ve presented, the use case is robust, evolutive, scalable, understandable, and useful.\\n\\nOnce the foundation architecture is laid out and more use cases and sources are added, an argument can be made for a __core data model__. This model would be built by a single transformation pipeline that unifies deduplication / delta calculation, data cleaning, GDPR compliance transformations and preparation of highly used KPIs for your use cases. The core transformation should be considered as a use case pipeline: its job is to prepare data, saving on computing resources and providing a single source of truth for other use cases. It is also a great way to ease data exploration for data savvy users in the sandbox, allowing them to be inspired through use case agnostic and clean datasets. To maintain relevance, the core data model should be updated with new data sources as they are added, and new use cases using that new source should feed on the cleaned and prepared datasets.\\n\\n![](img/datalake_part_1/core_data_model_full.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> A Core data model centralizes all cleaning and pre-calculations, further simplifying the storage architecture\\n </div>\\n <br/>\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nStarting with the identification of a first high impact use case, you\u2019ve been able to build a robust and evolutive datalake. Following the design principles we\u2019ve reviewed, data and use case pipelines in your datalake are usable and useful. You are now able to show a proof of value for your datalake and grow it into a central data platform for your company.\\n\\nThe final U we could dive deeper into is \u201cUsed\u201d : your goal is now to maintain, grow and manage the datalake as a unified data platform, centralizing data and solutions for your business. An efficient and relevant datalake project comes with technical design challenges, some of which we\u2019ve talked about here, but also organizational challenges. By finding solutions for technical challenges, your datalake has shown its value and it is now essential to ensure its growth. As you coordinate with business divisions, you\u2019ll be able to draw a roadmap for the datalake and improve processes at an organizational level, using \u201cdata mesh\u201d-like functional architectures that allow for the best flexibility in use cases, growing your platform\u2019s relevance and enhancing data capabilities for your business.\\n\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"/2022/01/27/automl_benchmark","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/01/27/automl_benchmark","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-27-automl_benchmark.md","title":"Which AutoML platform to choose to start your Data Science project?","description":"How do Automatic Machine Learning solutions work?

With Automated Machine Learning (Auto ML) however, it can take days at most for business professionals & Data Scientists alike to develop and compare dozens of models, find insights and solve business problems quickly. But what is AutoML, how does it work and what are the most popular AutoML solutions out there? In this article, we will introduce the field of Automated Machine Learning by exploring some popular AutoML frameworks and trying to answer those questions around how to make the right choice for your use case.\\n\\n\\n## What is AutoML and why it is interesting?\\n\\n### Definition\\n\\n\\nSebastian Raschka, a well regarded American statistics professor, states: \u2018\u2019Computer programming is about automation, and Machine Learning is all about automating automation\u2019\u2019. If that\u2019s true then we can say that Automated Machine Learning is the automation of automating automation..! AutoML is a new optimization technique which aims at automating some of the core - but highly iterative - parts of the traditional modelling process in ML, in particular feature selection and model selection (including hyperparameter tuning and stacking). Let\u2019s take the example of a Decision Tree Algorithm. This algorithm has many hyperparameters (leaf, depth, split etc.) and browsing through all those hyperparameters can take days. An AutoML algorithm can intelligently explore all the possible parameters in order to find the best possible ML algorithm solving a given task. Some advanced AutoML algorithms can even choose between different features, create new ones and try different data cleansing scenarios!\\n\\n\\n\\n### How AutoML can help us?\\n\\n![](img/automl/Steps_DS_automl_3.png)\\n\\nThere are many steps in a Machine Learning project, with Model Training typically being one of the most time consuming. A standard project will focus on a Business Problem and will pass through Data Collection, Cleaning and Processing before the training phase. Model Training can then be cumbersome as we have to select an appropriate model family and to fine tune many times differents hyperparameters before building the analysis and deploying the model. This process can take weeks or months, but it seems that several steps can be automated using optimization algorithms and that is the goal of auto ML.\\n\\n \\n\\nIn a sense, AutoML is seen as a way to increase productivity, to allow the Data Scientist to focus more on defining the problem and the analyses rather than the models finetuning, to help avoiding errors, and on top of that, to democratize Machine Learning so that everyone can leverage its power. Its integration within ML Engineering environment allows to streamline pipeline and integrate specific training jobs, that allows to parametrize a model search completely from a simple configuration file.\\n\\n\\n### Overview of the main AutoML frameworks in the market\\n\\nFor this article, we have selected 7 well known AutoML frameworks, but many more exist in the market. Below is an overview of some of the types of Data Science problems these AutoML solutions can address. Among them two are open source: AutoKeras & H2o and the others are not: with DataRobot, Dataiku, Azure, GCP, and AWS SageMaker. (2 other open-source solutions AutoKeras and AutoGluon were studied, but these frameworks are not available on Windows.)\\n\\n![](img/automl/automl_platforms_3.png)\\n\\nMany of the AutoML solutions address different types of Data Science problems such as Sentiment Analysis or Computer Vision, however what is going to interest us for the rest of is article are the Classification and Regression ML problems.\\n\\n\\n## Exploring the capabilities of several AutoML solutions\\n\\n### Our methodology (Classification/Regression, datasets Kaggle)\\n\\nThe purpose here is to bring some knowledge in the field of **Automated Machine Learning** by **exploring some popular AutoML frameworks**. In order to establish a performance benchmark, we decided to test those frameworks on **common ML topics** like **Regression** and **Classification**. The idea is also to share our personal experience (and difficulties encountered) with those tools so that everyone can have an overview of each one these AutoML solutions.\\n\\nThese packages were benchmarked on two classical datasets available on Kaggle. We chose the **Titanic Challenge** ([Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview)) for the Classification problem and the **House Prices Challenge** ([House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/rules)) for the Regression problem. For each framework, we submitted predictions on the test set on Kaggle so that we can compare the results to the general leaderboard. What is interesting with this approach is that we were able to compare performance not only between each AutoML solution but also with individual performance.\\n\\n![](img/automl/methodology_automl_3.png)\\n\\n\\n### Our results\\n\\n#### Classification Problem - Titanic Challenge\\n\\n![](img/automl/titanic_challenge_details_3.png)\\n\\nThe Titanic Challenge is one of the most famous on Kaggle with more than 30,000 challengers. The objective is to have a model which will predict if a Titanic passenger survives or not on a small data set with 9 features and around 900 rows in the training set. The metric used for this challenge is the accuracy and the leaderboard we have downloaded from Kaggle is provided below.\\n\\n![](img/automl/benchmark_titanic_challenge_3.png)\\n\\nEach point represents a challenger with the performance of all tested frameworks noted, with ranking & accuracy plotted on the x and y axis. We found that Azure has the best accuracy followed by H2O and that the accuracy for all frameworks ranges within 73% - 80%.\\n\\n\\n#### Regression Problem - House Prices Challenge\\n\\n![](img/automl/house_price_challenge_details_3.png)\\n\\nFor the House Prices Challenge, the goal is to predict the final price of residential homes in the United States. This time the metric is the root mean squared error, which is a metric that tells us the average distance between the predicted values from the model and the actual values in the dataset. We have around 8000 challengers (less challengers than the Titanic Challenge) and the dataset here is bigger with more than 250 features and around 1400 rows in the training set.\\n\\n![](img/automl/benchmark_houseprice_challenge_3.png)\\n\\nWe can see that all frameworks did better than the baseline RMSE. Each of the tested models fall between 0.24 - 0.12 in terms of the RSME and H2O again performs the best among other tested frameworks.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\n### Which AutoML solutions to choose?\\n\\nIn conclusion, which AutoML to choose? When making our decision, the framework performance is important, but not all frameworks were in fact easy to use. Conversely, we spent a lot of time on some frameworks, because some of them were not as intuitive as expected.\\n\\nUser friendliness must also therefore be a major criterion to consider when you are wondering which AutoML to use. That\u2019s why, in order to consider the frameworks performance on both the Kaggle challenge but also the user friendliness of each solution (if it is easy to install it, to get familiar with the tool, to set up the experiment without errors), we built two further metrics to evaluate each AutoML framework and to compare them.\\n\\n- On the x-axis: we give the ease of use for each AutoML framework from 1 to 10 (10 being the best)\\n\\n- On the y-axis: we took the average ranking on the both Kaggle challenge (the closer to 0, the better)\\n\\n![](img/automl/final_benchmark_3.png)\\n\\nThe metric \'ease of use\' is somewhat subjective as it refers to our own personal experience. However, we would add that one of the goals of AutoML is to make Machine Learning accessible to everyone, so for someone with very little knowledge, it is interesting to see how accessible the differents tools are.\\n\\nWe found that:\\n\\n- The cloud solutions are more difficult to master especially if you\u2019ve never used cloud computing before. In fact, some time is needed to get familiar with all the different functionalities of cloud solutions like Azure, AWS or GCP as there are powerful and comprehensive tools.\\n\\n- Dataiku and DataRobot are very easy to use and very visual, with many icons. These interfaces are very clear and simple.  If you want to use an extremely easy-to-use AutoML tool, which can perform automated machine learning very quickly, DataRobot and Dataiku seem to be good solutions.\\n\\n- H2O works as a notebook so if you are familiar working on a Jupyter notebook for example, it can definitely be a good option and not too painful to use. H2O seems to be a very good choice in terms of performance and ease of use. Moreover, this framework has the advantage of being completely open source.\\n\\n\\n### Final thoughts, our key takeaways\\n\\nThis article tries to compare 7 majors AutoML frameworks. To do so, we introduced a methodology that considers the performance of each solution, but also their ease of use. What appears clearl is that AutoML can definitely be a good starting point to an ML project. In fact, for both the Classification and Regression problem, all the frameworks performed almost as well, even better sometimes than the baseline, just by using the AutoML functionality.\\n\\nHowever, it is important to remember that automatically generated pipelines are still very basic and are not able to beat human experts yet. As we could see on the different benchmarks from Kaggle, Data Scientists still perform better. A Data Scientist analyzes the hidden information inside data, extracts useful correlations, gives useful insights about the business that has created data itself and all these tasks cannot be fully automated.\\n\\n\\n## References\\n\\nTo read more about AutoML:\\n\\n[2019 | AutoML: A Survey of the State-of-the-Art | Xin He, et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.00709.pdf) \\n\\n[2019 | Survey on Automated Machine Learning | Marc Zoeller, Marco F.

Some existing systems also struggle to supply enough energy to the homes and businesses that are on the grid. \\n\\n\\nIt is estimated that 592 million people in Africa are living without access to electricity. Most of these people live outside of urban centers and therefore out of reach of the continent\u2019s electricity grid. Furthermore, the existing systems in many African countries even struggle to supply enough energy to the homes and businesses that are on the grid. \\n\\n\\nPay-as-you-go (PAYGo) solar technology has become Africa\u2019s most promising approach to handling the continent\u2019s growing energy problems. PAYGo users pay a small downpayment for a solar kit that provides up to eight hours of emission-free lighting every day, as well as enough energy to charge mobile phones and other devices. \\n\\n\\n\\nWith PayGo solar, residents are able to reduce their energy spending by up to 50%. \\nThe objective of this challenge is to help predict the next six months of payments for different customers. This will allow PAYGo distributors to provide appropriate services and customer support, ensuring that they can continue to provide these important devices affordably and efficiently to the benefit of people all over Africa. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Why do we organize hackathons?\\n\\nAfter a long period of COVID19 marked by an almost generalized working from home, we wanted to allow our teams to meet in real life with the coworkers they only saw in back-to-back Teams calls, and work together on an important cause.  \\n\\nWe love hackathons at Ekimetrics as they enable: \\n\\n- To federate teams;\\n- To make people that don\'t usually work together collaborate to drive innovation;\\n- To get some practical experience at tackling new problems far from our usual business topics.\\n\\n\\nThat is why we organize two big hackathons every year and bi-monthly coding challenge sessions, some of which you can find in open source on our [hackathons homepage](https://ekimetrics.github.io/hacks/). \\nFor this event, we were lucky enough to be able to carry it out in our office while respecting all sanitary recommendations.\\n\\n\\n![](img/Hackathon_Stories_1/Team.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n## How to organize a hackathon for your data teams?\\n\\nHaving organized a dozen hackathons internally and for our clients, and participated in many of them, we have consolidated our learnings into a set of best practices which we are happy to share with you to help you organize your own hackathon for your data teams:\\n\\n- **Finding a platform** - There are also platforms integrating many public hackathons like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/) mentioned above. This time, we chose to contribute to an existing hackathon - see section below about developing a hackathon platform. \\n\\n- **Choosing a meaningful topic** - Get involved in a project or a project that matters to you and your colleagues. It\'s important to work on a different topic than your daily work, but you need to have passion. \\n\\n- **Preparing the minimum starting pack** - Focus on the answer to the problem and spend time preparing notebooks and training tools to facilitate the handling of the subject by the teams and allow them to increase their skills on new technologies. Maybe also find a few data points and some interesting resources and references to.\\n\\n- **Making balanced teams** - It is essential to balance the teams taking into account their varying levels of expertise and seniority;\\n\\n- **Timing, Timing, Timing** - \u23f1 It is necessary to pace the flow of the event, to allow participants to get into the topic and also to propose dedicated sessions allowing for discussions with the organizers and help throughout the event;\\n\\n- **Setting the adequate duration** - \ud83c\udfc1 Ideally, hackathons last between 6 and 8 hours over an evening and part of the night in order to condense the challenge as much as possible while allowing the teams to take control of the issues at stake - to 2 days to have time to build a demo.\\n\\n- **Proposing a baseline** - \ud83d\udcbb Depending on the topic it can be very useful to propose one or more examples of models allowing to build a base line from which to iterate;\\n\\n- **Communication** - \ud83d\udcac It is necessary to provide a common discussion thread for all participants as well as private channels by teams;\\n\\n- **Fun** - \ud83c\udf7e Of course pizzas, beers, and other refreshments to keep a good energy level and especially a nice atmosphere throughout the competition;\\n\\n- **Letting the stage** - \ud83d\ude0e Finally, to showcase the night\u2019s work, we always plan a pitch session the next day to present the projects in front of Ekimetrics partners and founders.\\n\\n- **Rewards & gifts** - \ud83c\udf81 A nice option is also to reserve gifts for the winners if you can decide of a winner \\n\\n![](img/Hackathon_Stories_1/Image32.png)\\n\\n\\n## Do you need a hackathon platform?\\nIf it is not an open innovation hackathon, and depending on the topic and how the competition works, it can be interesting to have a main hackathon platform for participants to upload their results, test their solutions and compare with other teams. In this case there are multiple solutions to consider : \\n\\n- Using existing platform like [Zindi Africa](https://zindi.africa/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or [Driven Data](https://www.drivendata.org/) \\n- Build your platform adapted to your needs, in particular now you can easily use [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to build your own. See some examples below;\\n- Not using a platform, avoid building a new one if you can focus on human relations, and the platform does not add value to the competition or the innovation \\n\\nFor our different [hackathons](https://ekimetrics.github.io/hacks/), we developed the platforms we needed : \\n\\n##### Our main platform for custom hackathons where we can compute a score between teams\\n![](img/Hackathon_Stories_1/platform.png)\\n\\n##### The platform we developed on Streamlit for our Data Science Escape Game\\n![](img/Hackathon_Stories_1/platform2.png)\\n\\n\\n## What is our hackathon philosophy at Ekimetrics?\\n\\n\\nOur goal is not to become \\"Kaggle masters\\" to reach the highest score.\\nWe are always keen to put forward the double hat (technical and business) of Ekimetrics consultants in order to give meaning to the data.\\nThat\'s why during this challenge we evaluate the teams around three dimensions:\\n\\n- The performance of the models;\\n\\n- The quality of the data analysis, the insights, and the quality of the visualizations;\\n\\n- The overall strategy to tackle the problem, going back to the bigger picture - i.e. broader issuers such as sustainable development.\\n\\nOffering different types of sub-challenges within the same hackathon created great opportunities for *all* Eki employees (including members of the marketing, HR or finance teams) to integrate within a team, which helped create links between people who do not always meet on a daily basis - let alone work together.\\n\\n\\n## If you want to do it yourself\\n\\nThis hackathon is open, do not hesitate to participate [here](https://zindi.africa/competitions/sfc-paygo-solar-credit-repayment-competition).\\n\\n**Thanks to all the participants !**"},{"id":"/2021/12/22/cjc","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/12/22/cjc","source":"@site/blog/2021-12-22-cjc.md","title":"Customer Journey Clustering - How to use sequential modeling techniques to handle customer journey data","description":"Enrich your understanding of customer journeys through clustering using  image embedding, autoencoders and unsupervised learning.","date":"2021-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 22, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Clustering","permalink":"/blog/tags/clustering"},{"label":"Autoencoders","permalink":"/blog/tags/autoencoders"},{"label":"Churn","permalink":"/blog/tags/churn"},{"label":"Interpretability","permalink":"/blog/tags/interpretability"}],"readingTime":11.6,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Sabri Belli","url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Customer Journey Clustering - How to use sequential modeling techniques to handle customer journey data","author":"Sabri Belli","author_url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com","header_image_url":"img/blog/customer_journey.jfif","image":"img/blog/customer_journey.jfif","tags":["Clustering","Autoencoders","Churn","Interpretability"],"draft":false,"description":"Enrich your understanding of customer journeys through clustering using  image embedding, autoencoders and unsupervised learning.","keywords":["Data Science","EkiLab","Ekimetrics","Eki.Lab","Eki","Machine Learning","Artificial Intelligence","Clustering","Machine Learning","Neural Networks","K-means","Autoencoders","Churn","Shapley values","Interpretability","Data Science for business"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Hackathon Stories - Ensuring access to affordable and clean energy","permalink":"/blog/2022/01/06/hackathon"},"nextItem":{"title":"Introduction to Pyepidemics - epidemiological modeling in Python","permalink":"/blog/introduction-pyepidemics"}},"content":"\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/CJC/customer_journey.jfif)\\n</div>\\n\\n\\n<div align = \\"justify\\">\\n\\n## Enriching understanding of customer journeys through clustering\\n\\nAnalyzing customer website behaviour is an essential step towards understanding the ways in which customers perceive and interact with a brand\u2019s products and services. Methods for analyzing these online interactions have improved in sophistication and depth of insight offered in recent years meaning many traditional methods, such as journey mapping now fall short. Exploring Customer Journeys, whilst more complex, offers brands the opportunity to dive deeper and obtain more granular insights that can then be used to optimise and improve the experience of future customers.\\n\\nEmploying advanced methodologies is not only beneficial, but it has also become a necessary action for any business that wants to explore the increasingly complex customer journeys possible on modern websites. To provide some context to this challenge - when investigating this possibility for one of our clients, a global leader in the telecom industry, we quickly realized that given the number of possible actions on their website (about 1,760), performing standard analysis would be overwhelming. It would, in fact, raise the number of potential journeys to something of the order of 10<sup>4900</sup>. To put this number into perspective, the number of atoms in the universe is of the order of 10<sup>100</sup>. A simple method of analysing customer journeys is mapping. Essentially creating a visual representation of every touchpoint your customers have with you, creating a fluid timeline from how you initially engaged them to their first purchase and tracking the ongoing relationship.  \\n\\n> \u2026 it would raise the number of possible journeys to something of the order of 10<sup>4900</sup>. To put this number into perspective, the number of atoms in the universe is of the order of 10<sup>100</sup>.\\n\\n\\n## Advancing methodologies - Creating groups of similar journeys through image embedding, autoencoders and unsupervised learning\\n\\nMany businesses are adapting strategic models to emphasise customer-centricity and build up their online presence. Websites, therefore, become a powerful asset in understanding customer behaviour through the data that they generate. And analyzing this data becomes a potential source of insight to improve future interactions with the customer base, driving loyalty and higher conversion. Journey mapping and other traditional methods can provide fast and high-level customer insight, which can be an important first step in making use of this asset. However, they often fall short as the numbers of potential journeys increase exponentially. \\n\\nJourney clustering is a more advanced approach that uses algorithms to analyse all journeys by identifying groups of customers who interact with the website in similar ways. In doing so, we identify patterns in customer behaviour and begin to understand the motivations behind their actions.  This type of analysis can be used by businesses to personalise their websites and improve customer experience. Ekimetrics\' innovative approach specifically uses advanced encoding and machine learning methods, as well as clustering algorithms to make sense of the complex digital world.\\n\\nTo address this challenge our approach requires three key steps: \\n\\n1. Reducing the dimensions of our customer journey dataset\\n\\n2. Creating image-like representations of customer journeys; one image represents one customer journey\\n\\n3. Applying clustering algorithms on images to create groups of users with similar behaviours. For each cluster, we are then able to define a \u201cstandard journey\u201d.\\n\\n\\n### Step 1: Reducing the dimensions of our dataset\\n\\nAnalyzing customer journeys is a difficult task that can lead to memory allocation errors, primarily due to high data diversity. Even for less sophisticated brands, the number of parameters feeding into a customer journey analysis model can quickly become unmanageable due to the sheer size of data needing to be analysed. \\n\\nFor example, the following features can be tracked: the URL of the pages visited, time spent on one page, overall duration on the website, user clicks, and many more.  The temptation is to add as much detail as possible, but more variables create more noise and lengthening computation time. \\n\\nA solution to this problem is to identify the most relevant variables - with respect to the business question we want to answer - to take forward through feature selection, these metrics can then be aggregated into a single data structure. This process serves two purposes: firstly reducing the size and complexity of our inputs and ensuring the outputs are directed towards the business objectives and free of unnecessary noise.\\n\\n### Step 2: Encoding and creating images to represent journeys\\n\\nCustomer Journeys are path-dependent processes that describe customers\u2019 interactions with different touchpoints, for example, all actions on a website leading up to purchase. To analyse these relationships we need to manipulate datasets to represent online journeys but also translate them into something that can be easily interpreted and modelled.\\n\\nTo do this and ensure no information is lost we create a 3D embedding \u2018image\u2019 that merges all this data into a single structure through the following processes:\\n\\n- Touchpoints that a customer has interacted with are represented in columns\\n\\n- The order in which interactions happen is represented in rows\\n\\n- A vector describing the quality of the customer interaction (e.g. time spent/number of clicks\u2026)\\n\\n\\n![](img/CJC/Image_1.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Building our 3D embedding through an iterative process\\n </div>\\n <br/>\\n\\nThe 3 parts for building our 3D embedding highlighted in the figure above are:\\n\\n- Given n, the number of possible interactions on the platform, it is possible to build a vector V=(1,n) representing all actions that a customer can perform. At a particular stage t, it is possible to fill V with \u201c0\u201c or \u201c1\u201d depending on the customer\u2019s action: if the i<sup>th</sup> action has been performed at stage t, set V(1,i)=1 , otherwise V(1,i)=0\\n\\n- It is then possible to replicate this process at every stage of the customer\u2019s journey in order to build a matrix M(l,n) where every line l represents the lth action performed by the customer\\n\\n- Finally, adding an indicator of the journey\u2019s quality consists of replacing the 0 & 1 in the previous matrix, with a vector of values describing the interactions.\\n\\n\\n![](img/CJC/Image_2.png)\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Example of an image decomposition through RGB channels\\n\\n\\n </div>\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n  \\n\\n:::note    \\n\\n\\nColourized pictures can be decomposed into Red, Green and Blue monochromatic sub-pictures.\\nIn our case, we can draw a parallel between the different indicators describing the interactions and the colourized levels of an image.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### Step 3: Clustering customer journey \u201cimages\u201d to identify standard paths\\nIn order to apply a clustering algorithm first, we had to clean and apply pre-processing to our data. We then had to control the dimensions in order to keep the number of variables below a defined threshold (we chose ~log #observations). To achieve such control we used autoencoder neural networks.\\n\\nThe goal of such algorithm is to learn a semantic representation by extracting the relevant signals from a given set of observations. This is a dimension reduction method that enables us to perform non-linear transformations. In other words autoencoders enable us to turn our inputs into meaningful and compressed data by getting rid of the non relevant information.\\n\\n:::info\\n\\nPCA is another such dimension reduction method that performs linear transformations.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n \\n![](img/CJC/Image_3.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Using a convolutional autoencoder to compress customer journeys </div>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n The above figure shows how an autoencoder performs on a dimension reduction problem. First, the input signal is compressed over the blue layers to reach a compressed representation (represented by the Dense layer). The signal is reconstructed using the green layers to then give the output. **The goal is to have similar inputs and outputs while controlling the size of the Dense layer.**\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above architecture is different from the classic convolutional autoencoders (classic autoencoders involve a succession of convolution and pooling layers for the encoding part, and upsampling layers for the decoding part). The architecture we used relies on convolution layers, and on deconvolution layers rather than upsampling ones. Since deconvolution layers are trainable (meaning that they depend on learnable parameters), and upsampling ones are not, this architecture can learn more complex transformations than a classic convolutional autoencoder of the same depth.\\n\\n *This architecture is inspired from the one described in this [article about Deep Clustering](https://xifengguo.github.io/papers/ICONIP17-DCEC.pdf)*.\\n\\nOnce we had completed the dimension reduction, we need to apply a clustering solution on the compressed customer journeys. We then assigned each group of similar customer journeys to a representative standard journey.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n:::note **A word about clustering**\\n\\nA clustering process consists of building groups of observations (e.g. customer journeys) based on their characteristics. The key components of the clustering process are:\\n-  Building groups containing similar observations: we talk about intra-class variance minimization.\\n-  Building groups that are different from each other: we talk about inter-class variance maximization.\\n\\nClustering tasks rely on unlabelled data (such learning tasks are known as \u2018unsupervised learning\u2019).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Making the customer journey analysis easier to perform - taking advantage of a reduced number of journeys\\n\\nPerforming a clustering algorithm on Customer Journeys aims to reduce the complexity of the analysis through the creation of groups with similar journeys. The analysis is easier to perform as it becomes possible to focus only on the representations of each group, instead of analyzing every single path. This method drastically reduces the number of journeys that require our attention. It also becomes possible to highlight complex similarities or patterns when creating these clusters.\\n\\n:::info \\nOnce the clusters are created, each of them is assigned to a standard journey (e.g. when using k-means, these standard journey are called centroids).\\n:::\\n\\n![](img/CJC/Image_4.png)\\n<div align=\\"center\\"> Example of standard journeys </div>\\n<br/>\\n \\n  \\n\\nThe example above shows three of these standard journeys. We can already see some interesting information and differences between the clusters:\\n\\n- Customers in the Standard journey #1 group complete more actions compared to #2 and #3.\\n\\n- All three standard journeys have different starting and ending pages that correspond to the first and last rows in the pictures). By looking at these standard journeys, at a glance we can already spot some initial differences between the clusters. \\n\\nNote that deeper analyses can be performed on these journeys by looking at the non-embedded data.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Leveraging the Customer Journey Clustering - three ways of improving customer-centric strategy\\n\\n\\nWe believe that this solution has several uses to improving the way businesses operate by better understanding customer behaviour, forming a stronger view of the customer lifetime value, and improving the user experience and conversion rate.\\n\\n\\n### Improving websites\\nWe can use customer journey clustering to build a representative journey (using the centroid of each cluster), establishing the usual actions a user performs between touchpoint A (e.g. website\u2019s homepage) and touchpoint B (e.g. website\u2019s purchasing page). These typical journeys help gain a better understanding of the customers\u2019 experiences, allowing us to identify ways to improve the website. \\n\\nFor example, it will help brands optimise the groups of products shown at the top of a landing page.\\n\\n\\n### Building audiences\\nBy understanding the size and similarities between groups that interact with our website Customer Journey Clustering is also a way to create specific audiences. It then allows brands to tailor their activity to engage with these specific audiences, improving the overall experience. \\n\\nFor example, if clusters 1 and 2 appear similar, but cluster 1 has a higher conversion rate than cluster 2, then analyzing the behaviours from cluster 1 may help us understand how to better retarget cluster 2. \\n\\nThese insights also make it possible to redirect customers through an optimal action that will drive more conversions.\\n\\n:::note\\nWe could go a step further by creating customer conversion scores based on their journey. These scores could then be used to build an optimized communication strategy, leading to the next optimal action (i.e. increase or reduce media spend, depending on the score). \\n:::\\n\\n### Improve churn prediction\\nAnother use case to Customer Journey clustering is evaluating churn and when customers are likely to shop with a competitor or stop ordering from us. When journeys are associated to a churn score, it becomes possible to create a predictive model that can be used to identify the groups that are more inclined to churn.\\n\\nFollowing the training of the model, the learnings could be applied to the standard journeys associated with each cluster, outputting a global churn score per cluster. These scores can then be evaluated and compared to other groups to better manage expected orders and improve communications with at-risk customers. \\n\\n:::note\\nSince a churn predictive model such as this is trained on the 3D embedded customer journeys, one can expect it to be capable of spotting complex churn patterns involving huge sequences of actions, or time spent per action.\\n:::\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nAt Ekimetrics we believe that customer journey clustering can help enhance the customer experience and increase customer lifetime value. We also know that with customer behaviours changing rapidly, an approach such as this provides a flexible solution that can translate into actionable insights for any business. \\n\\nHowever, complexity is not always the answer. A good model should tell a compelling and comprehensive story, but increased complexity must be accompanied by an effort to improve interpretability and should showcase enhanced benefits for business application.\\n\\nThe customer journey is still a challenge for every business globally. We do believe that there is no \xab plug and play \xbb answer and each solution needs to be built for the problem at hand. For us, intelligent data science means developing integrated approaches and leveraging different methods to help make brighter business decisions.\\n\\n\\n## Appendix\\n\\nTo give you more details, if we take an example where a user can perform up to 10 different actions on a website, the number of possible journeys is 9,864,100.\\n\\n:::info\\nGiven n the number of possible interactions, the number of possible journeys is given by the sum from 1 to n of the number of permutation of n.\\n:::\\n\\n## References\\n- Xifeng Guo, Xinwang Liu, En Zhu, and Jianping Yin.

We had the chance to work with many epidemiological experts, and as we went along we built a toolbox to facilitate our modeling of the current pandemics. We then put this toolbox in open source under the name **pyepidemics** to contribute to the community on this scientific discipline difficult to apprehend for Data Scientists but with obvious bridges facilitating innovation. \\nToday, with the resurgence of the epidemic in Europe, it seemed important to present this library more widely to democratize these analyses on a larger scale. \\n\\n- The library is available on Github at [this link](https://github.com/ekimetrics/pyepidemics)\\n- The documentation is available at [this link](https://ekimetrics.github.io/pyepidemics)\\n\\nThis article will serve as a synthetic presentation of what can be done with the library, please refer to the documentation for more details. Do not hesitate to post issues on Github and to contribute with new proposals, the development is still in experimental version. \\n\\n### Introduction to Pyepidemics\\nPyepidemics allows to simply create compartmental epidemiological models (also used in system dynamics) and to solve the differential equations that model the phenomenon. The different features implemented today are: \\n\\n- Creation of classical compartmental models (SIR, SEIR, SEIDR, etc...)\\n- Creation of COVID19 related model (with ICU and different levels of symptoms)\\n- Creation of custom compartmental model\\n- Implementation of policies (lockdown, tracing, testing, etc...)\\n- Calibration of epidemiological parameters on real-world data using Bayesian optimization\\n\\n### Installation\\nYou can simply install pyepidemics using the command \\n```\\npip install pyepidemics\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Introduction to epidemiological modeling in Python\\nThe images, the reasoning and the construction of the first bricks of the library are largely inspired by the exceptional work of Henri Froese with his series of articles on epidemiology, in particular the first article [Infectious Disease Modelling: Beyond the Basic SIR Model](https://towardsdatascience.com/infectious-disease-modelling-beyond-the-basic-sir-model-216369c584c4). \\n\\n### Compartmental models\\nAn epidemic is modeled with the different possible states for the population, for example: unaffected, immunized, vaccinated, symptomatic patient, asymptomatic patient, hospitalized, in intensive care ... Each state will be modeled with a compartment, and the population will transition between the different compartments according to parameters of probability and transition duration. In concrete terms, this means solving a system of differential equations as a function of time. \\n\\nFor example the simplest compartmental model is the SIR model (for the 3 states Susceptible - Infected - Removed). \\nIt is possible to write the following compartments with their transition:\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/introduction-pyepidemics/sir.png)\\n\\n</div>\\nThe transition parameters being given by : \\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/introduction-pyepidemics/sir2.png)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Building a SIR model with pyepidemics\\nThis section is detailed in this [tutorial](https://ekimetrics.github.io/pyepidemics/tutorials/quickstart/) which is also available directly on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ekimetrics/pyepidemics/blob/master/docs/tutorials/quickstart.ipynb). \\n\\n#### Using the bank of models\\nAs the SIR model is a standard model, you can find an already coded version in the model bank. We will learn in the next section how this abstraction is built to allow you to add details in the modeling. \\n\\nWith pyepidemics:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pyepidemics.models import SIR\\n\\nN = 1000 # Thousand persons\\nbeta = 3/4 # One person contaminates 3/4 person per day\\ngamma = 1/4 # One person stay infected for 4 days\\n\\nsir = SIR(N,beta,gamma)\\n```\\n\\nIt is then possible to solve the system of differential equations simply with the method ``.solve()`` (more parameters are available, see the tutorial quoted above : \\n\\n```python\\nstates = sir.solve()\\nstates.show(plotly = False)\\n```\\n\\nWhat is commonly called an epidemic \\"wave\\" is observed. \\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/introduction-pyepidemics/sir3.png)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n#### Reimplementing the SIR model\\nLet\'s now go into the internal workings of this abstraction to reimplement its operation in a few lines of code. Concretely we build a graph between the different states by detailing the transitions. Pyepidemics then translates this graph into a system of differential equations in order to solve it. \\n\\n```python\\nfrom pyepidemics.models import CompartmentalModel\\n\\nclass SIR(CompartmentalModel):\\n    def __init__(self,N,beta,gamma):\\n\\n        # Define compartments name and number\\n        compartments = [\\"S\\",\\"I\\",\\"R\\"]\\n        super().__init__(compartments)\\n\\n        # Parameters\\n        self.N = N # Total population\\n        self.beta = beta # How many person each person infects per day\\n        self.gamma = gamma # Rate of infection, duration = 1/gamma\\n\\n        # Add transition\\n        self.add_transition(\\"S\\",\\"I\\",lambda y,t: self.beta * y[\\"S\\"] * y[\\"I\\"] / self.N)\\n        self.add_transition(\\"I\\",\\"R\\",lambda y,t: self.gamma * y[\\"I\\"])\\n```\\n\\nSo it is possible to build any kind of compartmental model with this operation. You can see more complex examples in this [tutorial](https://ekimetrics.github.io/pyepidemics/tutorials/custom_model/).\\n\\n## Create a realistic epidemiological model for COVID19\\nIn the first section we saw how to build a SIR model, however we are far from being able to use this model to simulate an epidemic like COVID19 and for governments to be able to take actions using those analyses. For this we would need to:\\n- Have a more complete description taking into account the specifics of the disease states\\n- Take into account the mitigation strategies provided by governments\\n- Calibrate the model to describe the evolution of the epidemic as closely as possible\\n\\n### Build the right compartmental model\\nIndeed, the COVID19 is more specific than simply the 3 SIR states described above. During the year 2020, we used the following compartmental model inspired by the work of the Pasteur Institute and the INSERM (taking into account the different levels of symptoms, the incubation phase, and the passages in hospital or in intensive care)\\n\\n![](img/introduction-pyepidemics/model.png)\\n\\nYou can look in the library at the implementation of the ``COVID19`` model to see the implementation (very close to what has been described above for the SIR model, one of the strengths of pyepidemics). \\n\\n### Describe the mitigation solutions implemented (containment, testing)\\nSome parameters, such as the famous \\"R0\\", have varied enormously during the epidemic depending on behaviors (distancing, masks), policies (testing, lockdowns, vaccination), or variants of the epidemic. Thus, to create a realistic model, we need to take these variations into account. \\nWe will take the example of the first lockdowns to understand how to implement these variations with pyepidemics.   \\n\\nLet\'s create an evolution of the parameter ``R(t)`` according to the different lockdowns (during the first wave for example)\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pyepidemics.policies.utils import make_dynamic_fn\\n\\npolicies = [\\n    3.3/4,\\n    (1/4,53),\\n    (2/4,80),\\n]\\n\\nfn = make_dynamic_fn(policies,sigmoid = False)\\n\\n# Create our time-dependent parameter\\nbeta = lambda y,t : fn(t)\\n\\n# Visualize policies\\nx = np.linspace(0,100)\\ny = np.vectorize(fn)(x)\\nplt.figure(figsize = (15,4))\\nplt.plot(x,y)\\nplt.show()\\n```\\n![](img/introduction-pyepidemics/policies.png)\\n\\nAnd that\'s it! We can use this time-dependent parameter like we used a constant before. To see more complete examples and results, you can redirect to this [tutorial](https://ekimetrics.github.io/pyepidemics/tutorials/beyond-sir/).\\n\\n### Find the most appropriate parameters for calibration\\nFinally, in the previous example, as in those before, we chose arbitrarily the values of the different probabilities and transition times. But these are precisely what epidemiologists want to estimate. How does this work? Simply by testing different parameters until the solution of the compartmental model matches as much as possible the real evolution of the epidemic. Of course, we are not going to test all the combinations but rather : \\n- Start with an a priori on the different parameter values from the most recent epidemiological studies \\n- Use a Bayesian optimization algorithm to go through the parameter space efficiently without having to calculate everything. \\n\\nThese two methods are easy to implement with pyepidemics if we have a pyepimemics model with a ``.reset()`` method that recreates a compartmental model with the new set of parameters. First we create a parameter space to explore:\\n\\n```python\\nspace = {\\n    \\"beta_low\\":(0.01,0.4),\\n    \\"beta_high\\":(0.6,1.5),\\n    \\"I0\\":(0,100),\\n    \\"recovery_rate_asymptomatic\\":(1/8,1/2),\\n    \\"recovery_rate_mild\\":(1/8,1/2),\\n    \\"death_rate_hospital\\":(0.006,0.02),\\n    \\"death_rate_icu\\":(0.006,0.02),\\n    \\"recovery_rate_icu\\":(0.02,0.08),\\n    \\"recovery_rate_hospital\\":(0.02,0.08),\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThen we will simply use the method ``.fit()`` by giving as input a *dataframe* with the real values of the epidemic for the compartments for which we would have succeeded in obtaining data (in general the deaths and the hospital stays which are the most reliable). \\n\\n```python\\nmodel.fit(\\n    cases[[\\"D\\",\\"H\\",\\"ICU\\"]],\\n    space,\\n    n = 200,\\n    early_stopping = 100,\\n)\\n```\\n\\nThis step is not easy, takes time and often also requires iterations to change the definition of the compartmental model. But once solved it is what allows epidemiologists to follow the dynamics of the pandemic. \\n\\nMore details on calibration are available in this [tutorial](https://ekimetrics.github.io/pyepidemics/tutorials/calibration/). \\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWith this article we could introduce you to our epidemiological modeling library pyepidemics - simple modeling, flexible compartmental models, calibration, dynamic parameters, etc... The details of the different features are available in the library documentation. \\n\\nAs previously mentioned, this library is still under experimental development, we are still using it to model the 5th wave of the epidemic, in particular by adding compartments for vaccination - we will write an article on the modeling in the coming months. Do not hesitate to contribute to democratize this discipline to the Data Science community. \\n\\n## References\\nThese few references helped us greatly during the development of the library\\n- [Infectious Disease Modelling: Beyond the Basic SIR Model](https://towardsdatascience.com/infectious-disease-modelling-beyond-the-basic-sir-model-216369c584c4)\\n- [Expected impact of lockdown in \xcele-de-France and possible exit strategies](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.08.20095521v1) - by INSERM\\n- [Estimating the burden of SARS-CoV-2 in France](https://hal-pasteur.archives-ouvertes.fr/pasteur-02548181/document) - by Institut Pasteur\\n\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"/2021/11/03/tsp","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/11/03/tsp","source":"@site/blog/2021-11-03-tsp.md","title":"Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Reinforcement Learning","description":"A practical use of Reinforcement Learning and the Q-Learning algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem","date":"2021-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 3, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Reinforcement Learning","permalink":"/blog/tags/reinforcement-learning"},{"label":"Logistics","permalink":"/blog/tags/logistics"}],"readingTime":13.805,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Th\xe9o Alves Da Costa","title":"Head of AI For Sustainability","url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com","key":"theo.alves"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Reinforcement Learning","authors":["theo.alves"],"header_image_url":"img/blog/tsp.jfif","image":"img/blog/tsp.jfif","tags":["Reinforcement Learning","Logistics"],"draft":false,"description":"A practical use of Reinforcement Learning and the Q-Learning algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem","keywords":["Data Science","EkiLab","Ekimetrics","Eki.Lab","Eki","Machine Learning","Artificial Intelligence","Reinforcement Learning","Logistics","Supply Chain","Data Science for business"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Introduction to Pyepidemics - epidemiological modeling in Python","permalink":"/blog/introduction-pyepidemics"},"nextItem":{"title":"Deploying a Python Dash application for beginners","permalink":"/blog/dash-deployment"}},"content":"\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n<div align=\\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/tsp/tsp.jfif)\\n  \\n</div>\\n\\n## Summary\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nReinforcement Learning (RL) is usually applied for state of the art AI research and often make the headlines. Yet it still fails to deliver on concrete business topics. At Ekimetrics we strive to transfer AI innovations into the business world and Reinforcement Learning is a unbelievable playground to find disruptive solutions to complex real-world problems. In particular, there are many optimization problems that could be solved using RL.\\n\\nThe Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) has been solved for many years and used for tons of real-life situations including **optimizing deliveries** or **network routing**. This article will show a simple framework to **apply Q-Learning to solving the TSP**, and discuss the pros & cons with other optimization techniques. It\'s a perfect introduction for beginners in Reinforcement Learning and does not require heavy computational capabilities.\\n\\n> You can find all the code open sourced [here on Github](https://github.com/TheoLvs/reinforcement-learning/tree/master/5.%20Delivery%20Optimization)\\n\\n\\n## The Traveling Salesman Problem\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/tsp/tsp_example.png)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\nThe Traveling Salesman Problem (or TSP) is a typical optimization problem, where one has to find the shortest route to visit different cities. There are many different ways to solve this problem using discrete optimization techniques. \\n\\nLike many optimization problems, it\'s a NP-hard problem, which in short means that it\'s easy (in terms of speed) to solve for 5 cities, already impossible to brute force for 50. And almost impossible for most algorithms for  5,000 cities. Even for 15 cities, it\'s already 1 trillion permutations to compute (15!), there are optimization techniques that are more adequate : dynamic programming, branch and bound algorithms, nearest neighbors approximations, or ant colonies optimizations.\\n\\nFurthermore, the problem described here is too simple to describe a real-life delivery situation. It does not take into account multiple vehicle fleet, electric vehicle charging, time window constraints, capacity constraints, aleatory perturbations, etc... Hence, each variant of the TSP has its own optimization frameworks (in terms of variables and constriants), and the more you complexify the problem, the more difficult it is of course. That\'s why in practice delivery companies use combinations of those variants coupled with heuristics. The most advanced companies today add Machine Learning techniques on top of those algorithms, in particular to replace manual heuristics and better estimate in-context durations.    \\n\\nIn Python, the easiest way to get started with TSP and its variants is probably the great open source library [OR-Tools by Google](https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing). And if you want to learn more about discrete optimization, I can only recommend the great MOOC on *Discrete Optimization by the University of Melbourne* you can find on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization). \\n\\n## Applying Reinforcement Learning to the TSP\\n### Why bother using Reinforcement Learning?\\nIf it\'s already solved by classical optimization techniques, why bother using Reinforcement Learning? Well several answers: \\n\\n- It\'s fun and I personally love practicing RL. Curiosity is a great driver for innovation, and here I was really wondering if it could be applied for such a problem.\\n- RL is rarely used in real-life problems. Playing games or manipulating robot hands is awesome, but when it comes to business problems, RL often fails compared to simple heuristics or algorithms. At Ekimetrics, we always look for applying state-of-the-art AI research to the business problems we encounter in the real-world. \\n\\nHowever, Reinforcement Learning (in theory) would hold many advantages compared to classical optimization techniques : \\n\\n- **Offering a general framework for all problems**, indeed instead of tweaking the constraints and defining extra variables, you can change the reward, and defining a multi agent problem if needed for fleet optimization. Adding extra information like delivery time estimation is also eased if you can integrate the prediction algorithm with a similar ML techniques (e.g. Neural Networks)\\n- **Having a \\"live\\" decision making algorithm**. Because you would train a RL alorithm by making the next delivery decision at each stop, compared to \\"offline\\" optimization algorithms that study the problem with no unknowns, you inherently would be able to take different decisions if something happened during the experience, whereas you would need to recalculate with classical techniques\\n- **Being robust to unknowns and aleatory perturbations**\\n\\n### Transforming the TSP to a RL problem\\nBefore jumping into the TSP variants, let\'s take the most simplest version: *a delivery man who has to deliver 50 packages*. Between each stop can be defined a distance or a duration (or a more complex metric). \\n\\nTo transform it to a RL problem, we need to define: \\n\\n- **Agent**: the delivery man\\n- **Environment**: the different packages to deliver (and their destination) and the city where to navigate\\n- **States**: the location where the delivery guy currently stops \\n- **Actions**: at each location, the decisions to make (modeled as a Markov process) are: \\"where to go next\\" (or \\"which location do I chose next\\")\\n- **Reward**: Between two locations (states), how long (or how far) it is\\n\\n### Creating the routing environment\\nCreating a simple version of the environment is quite simple in pure Python. Indeed, you can store the position of the stops in a 2D virtual world as a numpy array or a Pandas DataFrame. Distances between stops can be calculated with an euclidean distance, but it could be complexified to account for durations or represent any distance/duration metric you would see in a routing network. \\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/tsp/env2.png)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n```python\\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import cdist\\n\\nENV_SIZE = 10\\nN_STOPS = 100\\n\\n# Creating the stops using numpy random points generator\\nxy = np.random.rand(N_STOPS,2)*ENV_SIZE\\n\\n# Computing the distances between each points\\n# Here use euclidean distances, but any metric would do\\n# This distance matrix can actually represent a time, a distance or something else\\ndistance_matrix = cdist(xy,xy)\\n```\\n\\nThen we want to define the starting position, the route, and the end position. Meaning that if we have to traverse A, B, C, D, E, possible routes would be for example ``A->C->B->E->D`` or ``B->D->E->C->A``. \\n\\nBy the way with 5 stops you have 5! possible routes or 120 possible routes. For 10 stops you already have 3.6 million possible routes. For 100 stops it\'s 10 to the 158th power routes. It\'s called the combinatory explosion, and that explains why this simple problem is impossible to brute force for a high number of stops. \\n\\nWe can visualize routes by drawing lines between each stop\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/tsp/env1.png)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nWe can also already imagine more complex and realistic situations. For example, one experiment I wanted to do was to stress test the RL algorithm to aleatory events. For example a known environment with unknown perturbations, like traffic. To model this interaction, we add a \\"traffic zone\\" inside our environment, where routes are much slower if taken. To account for the extra duration, we calculate the intersection points of the route within the \\"traffic zone\\" and measure the distance of the formed segment, we then use that distance weighed with a traffic intensity factor. \\n\\n```\\ni1,i2 = intersections\\ndistance_traffic = np.sqrt((i2[1]-i1[1])**2 + (i2[0]-i1[0])**2)\\nadditional_reward = distance_traffic * traffic_intensity * np.random.rand()\\n```\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/tsp/env3.png)\\n\\n</div>\\nNow that we have the overal idea, we have to design an environment object in Python to be fed to a Reinforcement Learning agent. We use the typical design framework inspired from OpenAI Gym:\\n\\n```python\\nclass DeliveryEnvironment:\\n\\n    def reset(self):\\n        \\"\\"\\"Restart the environment for experience replay\\n        Returns the first state\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        pass\\n\\n    def step(self,a):\\n        \\"\\"\\"Takes an action in a given state\\n        Returns:\\n            s_next: the next state\\n            reward: the reward for such action\\n            done: if the simulation is done\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        pass\\n\\n    def render(self):\\n        \\"\\"\\"Visualize the environment state\\n        \\"\\"\\"\\n        pass\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Designing the Q-Learning algorithm\\nBefore jumping into complex Deep Learning, I wondered if a simple **Q-Learning framework would work**. Basically with Q-Learning you want to evaluate a matrix mapping states, actions and rewards. Indeed to make a decision in a given state about the best actions to do, you would love to have an estimate if the decision was the best in the long term. This is represented by the Q values. \\n\\nIn our case, the rows are the different states (all the stops) and the columns the possible actions to take in this state, hence the next stop to go. The values are the estimated long-term reward you would get by taking this action. So, if you are found in a state A, you would like to take the action with the maximum Q value. \\n\\nFor our TSP problem for example, we would have a Q-Matrix of 50 by 50 if we have 50 stops. \\n\\nBecause we want to inform the routing algorithm with as much unbiased data we can find, we can actually initalize the Q matrix (also called Value function because it maps out states and actions to rewards - the values) with the distance matrix between all stops. Indeed, if you would not consider a long-term decision making strategy, you would apply a greedy one where you would chose the closest stop as a next destination. Yet it would definetely be better than random. \\n\\n```python\\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import cdist\\nQ = cdist(xy,xy)\\n```\\n\\nOk, but how to update those values and incorporate long-term planning? This is exactly the goal of the Q-Learning algorithm. \\nImagine you are delivering pizzas every day all across the city, you have an old GPS to help you decide the shortest route between your stops. But your city is much more complicated than what you and your GPS know. What would happen? \\n\\n- The first day, you would chose the closest stop first and then jump to the next closest one. You will quickly realize that it\'s not optimized. You should maybe have gone first to another neighborhood and deliver everything in the area before jumping to another one. \\n- So the next day, you commit to another strategy, armed with yesterday\'s experience. Definitely, looking ahead and avoiding single deliveries in remote areas even if they are closest is a better idea. But while you are exploring the best routes, you pass through the city center and get blocked into traffic that terribly slows you down. \\n- The 3rd day, you will try to apply the same general strategy, but definitely if possible you will never go through the city center, and try circling around the city to save some precious time. \\n\\nThis **trial-and-error behavior is basically how experience replay works in the Reinforcement Learning framework**. \\n\\nIf we code an agent abstraction, it could look like this:\\n```python\\nclass QAgent(Agent):\\n    def __init__(self,states_size,actions_size,epsilon = 1.0,\\n    epsilon_min = 0.01,epsilon_decay = 0.999,gamma = 0.95,lr = 0.8):\\n        self.states_size = states_size\\n        self.actions_size = actions_size\\n        self.epsilon = epsilon\\n        self.epsilon_min = epsilon_min\\n        self.epsilon_decay = epsilon_decay\\n        self.gamma = gamma\\n        self.lr = lr\\n        self.Q = self.build_model(states_size,actions_size)\\n\\n\\n    def build_model(self,states_size,actions_size):\\n        Q = np.zeros([states_size,actions_size])\\n        return Q\\n\\n\\n    def train(self,s,a,r,s_next):\\n        self.Q[s,a] = self.Q[s,a] + self.lr * (r + self.gamma*np.max(self.Q[s_next,a]) - self.Q[s,a])\\n\\n        if self.epsilon > self.epsilon_min:\\n            self.epsilon *= self.epsilon_decay\\n\\n\\n    def act(self,s):\\n\\n        q = self.Q[s,:]\\n\\n        if np.random.rand() > self.epsilon:\\n            a = np.argmax(q)\\n        else:\\n            a = np.random.randint(self.actions_size)\\n\\n        return a\\n```\\n\\nThe most important line is this one:\\n\\n```python\\nself.Q[s,a] = self.Q[s,a] + self.lr * (r + self.gamma*np.max(self.Q[s_next,a]) - self.Q[s,a])\\n```\\n\\nThis is the update rule in basic Q-Learning, where you increment the Q-value for each action in each experience replay (simulating a day of delivery hundreds of time) by the current reward + the reward for the best possible action you would take in the future. This recursive equation is a variation of the famous Bellman equation for Q value functions. \\n\\nNotice two factors: \\n- The learning rate ``lr`` control the learning speed (like in Deep Learning)\\n- The gamma factor ``gamma`` is the discount factor, and control long-term planning. Indeed if gamma = 0, you will only get the next action reward (your agent is \\"short sighted\\" only seeking current rewards), if gamma = 1 you will be more oriented towards the future rewards (above 1 it may diverge)\\n\\nThose two factors are our most important hyperparameters to tune during training (there are others like the epsilon variables defined in the initialization, if you are curious take a look at epsilon-greedy methods, a super simple way of tackling the exploration-exploitation dilemma in Reinforcement Learning)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Writing the training loop\\n\\nOnce we have define the environment, the Q-Agent and the update rules for the value function, we only need the final step: the training loop. We will apply **experience replay** to our poor delivery guy stucked in an infinite time loop. \\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/tsp/drstrange.gif) \\n\\n</div>\\n\\nEvery day, over and over, he will try to deliver our 50 packages, find the best routes and do it all over the next day. In Reinforcement Learning we call each day an **episode**, where we simply:\\n- Reset the environment\\n- Make a decision of the next state to go to\\n- Remember the reward gained by this decision (minimum duration or distance elapsed)\\n- Train our agent with this knowledge\\n- Make the next decision until all stops are traversed\\n\\n```python\\ndef run_episode(env,agent,verbose = 1):\\n\\n    s = env.reset()\\n    agent.reset_memory()\\n    max_step = env.n_stops\\n    episode_reward = 0\\n    \\n    i = 0\\n    while i < max_step:\\n\\n        # Remember the states\\n        agent.remember_state(s)\\n\\n        # Choose an action\\n        a = agent.act(s)\\n        \\n        # Take the action, and get the reward from environment\\n        s_next,r,done = env.step(a)\\n\\n        # Tweak the reward\\n        r = -1 * r\\n        \\n        if verbose: print(s_next,r,done)\\n        \\n        # Update our knowledge in the Q-table\\n        agent.train(s,a,r,s_next)\\n        \\n        # Update the caches\\n        episode_reward += r\\n        s = s_next\\n        \\n        # If the episode is terminated\\n        i += 1\\n        if done:\\n            break\\n            \\n    return env,agent,episode_reward\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Results\\n\\n### Q-Learning for a simple TSP\\n\\nWhen you start training and experiencing the same problem overtime, your agent learns about the environment, this is shown by the episode rewards values for each experience replay. \\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n![](img/tsp/training.png)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n- In the first phase, until the 400th episode, you are still exploring the different routes. Indeed with the epsilon decay method (with ``epsilon_decay=0.999``), you are taking random actions at each step. \\n- In the second phase, epsilon is lowering, and you start exploiting what you have learnt, and take less and less random actions to be more driven by Q values. \\n\\nWhat\'s tricky with epsilon-greedy methods, is that it kind of forces of the convergence. So did it work? Let\'s see. \\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n##### 50 stops experiment\\n![](img/tsp/training_50_stops.gif)\\n\\n##### 100 stops experiment\\n![](img/tsp/training_100_stops.gif)\\n\\n##### 500 stops experiment\\n![](img/tsp/training_500_stops.gif)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nIn each experiment, the algorithm converges quite fast to a seamingly acceptable route. After exploring a lot of options it not only gives one route but variations of the accepted strategy, which can already be interesting to find alternatives. \\n\\n### Q-Learning for a TSP with traffic zones\\n\\nNow that we have our environment, agent and framework defined, what\'s great with RL is that we don\'t have to change anything but the reward to model a different situation. Indeed because we tweaked the reward when you drove through a traffic zone, the agent will learn the same way to optimize his holistic route. \\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n##### 100 stops experiment with traffic zones\\n![](img/tsp/training_100_stops_traffic.gif)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n\\nEureka, the agent will avoid as much as possible the traffic zones\\n\\n<div align = \\"center\\">\\n\\n##### 500 stops experiment with traffic zones\\n![](img/tsp/training_500_stops_traffic.gif)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nWith more points, it\'s even more interesting, the agent will really circle around the traffic zone and prefer longer but faster routes. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Next steps\\n\\nI hope this simple experiment has highlighted how to apply (non-Deep Learning) Reinforcement Learning techniques to real-life problems. I haven\'t had time to benchmark the resolution against other optimization techniques (which I should have done I confess), but let\'s try to draw some pros and cons for the approach. \\n\\n##### \u26d4 Cons:\\n- Probably slower\\n- Definitely less accurate than a discrete optimization technique\\n  \\n##### \u2705 Pros:\\n- General framework to be updated in real-life situations (eg: the traffic) and extended to more complex problems\\n- Alternative routes are proposed\\n- \\"Online\\" decision making (meaning that you have an algorithm armed with a next-best decision recommendation system)\\n\\nNext steps is to extend the work to an even more global framework to account for multiple vehicle fleets, charging stations and more. The latter idea will require to use Deep Reinforcement Learning because states could not be represented as a matrix, and will probably be more difficult (impossible?) to train, but that\'s a topic for a next article!  \\n\\n## References\\n- All the code is open sourced [here](https://github.com/TheoLvs/reinforcement-learning/tree/master/5.%20Delivery%20Optimization) on Github\\n- OR-Tools [open source library](https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing) by Google\\n- MOOC on [discrete optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization) by the University of Melbourne on Coursera\\n- The timeless [MOOC on Reinforcement Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&ab_channel=DeepMind) by David Silver at Deepmind\\n\\n\\n</div>"},{"id":"dash-deployment","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/dash-deployment","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-16-dash-deployment.md","title":"Deploying a Python Dash application for beginners","description":"Learn the basics of application deployment from simple examples on Heroku to creating Docker containers","date":"2021-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 16, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Industrialization","permalink":"/blog/tags/industrialization"}],"readingTime":4.7,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Th\xe9o Alves Da Costa","title":"Head of AI For Sustainability","url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com","key":"theo.alves"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"dash-deployment","title":"Deploying a Python Dash application for beginners","authors":["theo.alves"],"header_image_url":"img/blog/dash-deployment.jpg","image":"img/blog/dash-deployment.jpg","tags":["Industrialization"],"description":"Learn the basics of application deployment from simple examples on Heroku to creating Docker containers","keywords":["Data Science","EkiLab","Ekimetrics","Eki.Lab","Eki","Machine Learning","Artificial Intelligence","Industrialization","Docker","Heroku","Python","Dash"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Reinforcement Learning","permalink":"/blog/2021/11/03/tsp"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome to the new Ekimetrics Tech website!","permalink":"/blog/welcome"}},"content":"<div align=\\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](img/dash-deployment/dash-deployment.jpg)\\n  \\n</div>\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## Creating a Dash application\\nBefore deployment, the first step if of course to create your own application. <br/>\\nYou can follow the guidelines in Dash official documentation https://dash.plotly.com/installation\\n\\n![](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/Manager/apps_data/dash-oil-and-gas/thumbnail_0a718df0-9ce7-11e9-8982-0242ac11004a.png)\\n\\n## Deploying your Dash application\\nhttps://dash.plotly.com/deployment\\nDash/Plotly offers a paid service to super easily deploy and manager your applications. Yet as most of it is open source, and you may want a simple thing for a prototype, you can simply deploy it in your own server.\\n\\nThen you have several options: \\n- Beginners - Deploy it on a simple Heroku server\\n- Advanced - Deploy it on a cloud server (AWS, GCP, Azure) with docker containers\\n\\n### Deploying on Heroku from GitHub\\nHeroku is the most simple server provider. It\'s even more simpleYou can create and deploy apps for free in just a few minutes. That\'s what we are going to do here : \\n\\n- Create your dash app, eg ``app.py`` (from Dash tutorial)\\n\\n```python\\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\\n\\n# Run this app with `python app.py` and\\n# visit http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in your web browser.\\n\\nimport dash\\nimport dash_core_components as dcc\\nimport dash_html_components as html\\nimport plotly.express as px\\nimport pandas as pd\\n\\nexternal_stylesheets = [\'https://codepen.io/chriddyp/pen/bWLwgP.css\']\\n\\napp = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=external_stylesheets)\\nserver = app.server\\n\\n# assume you have a \\"long-form\\" data frame\\n# see https://plotly.com/python/px-arguments/ for more options\\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\\n    \\"Fruit\\": [\\"Apples\\", \\"Oranges\\", \\"Bananas\\", \\"Apples\\", \\"Oranges\\", \\"Bananas\\"],\\n    \\"Amount\\": [4, 1, 2, 2, 4, 5],\\n    \\"City\\": [\\"SF\\", \\"SF\\", \\"SF\\", \\"Montreal\\", \\"Montreal\\", \\"Montreal\\"]\\n})\\n\\nfig = px.bar(df, x=\\"Fruit\\", y=\\"Amount\\", color=\\"City\\", barmode=\\"group\\")\\n\\napp.layout = html.Div(children=[\\n    html.H1(children=\'Hello Dash\'),\\n\\n    html.Div(children=\'\'\'\\n        Dash: A web application framework for Python.\\n    \'\'\'),\\n\\n    dcc.Graph(\\n        id=\'example-graph\',\\n        figure=fig\\n    )\\n])\\n\\nif __name__ == \'__main__\':\\n    app.run_server(debug=True)\\n```\\n\\n- Create a requirements file, eg ``requirements.txt``. You can use tools such as ``pipreqs``, ``pipenv`` or other environment managers to help you create the right file. \\n- Don\'t forget to add if not present the requirements to ``gunicorn`` in your requirements file\\n- Create a Procfile - it\'s a text file to help Heroku understand what file to be launched on the server. Write in it the following command. \\n  \\n```\\nweb: gunicorn app:server\\n```\\n\\n- As of ``2020-12-01``, Dash documentation is not totally correct when it comes to deployment on Heroku, you should correctly link the server variable in Python and the declaration in the ``Procfile`` :\\n  \\n```python\\n# Add following line in your app.py script\\nserver = app.server\\n\\n# Write the Procfile\\n# - app refer to the file name app.py\\n# - server refer to the variable name for the Flask Server \\nweb: gunicorn app:server\\n```\\n\\nAt the end your repo on Github should look like this:\\n\\n```\\napp.py\\nProcfile\\nrequirements.txt\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n- Deploy directly on Heroku from GitHub, you can follow the instructions below\\n\\n  - Create a new application\\n![](img/dash-deployment/deploy1.jpg)\\n  - Find the right name and server region\\n![](img/dash-deployment/deploy2.jpg)\\n  - Link via github, search for your repo and click on connect\\n![](img/dash-deployment/deploy3.jpg)\\n  - Deploy manually by clicking on deploy and choosing the right github branch\\n![](img/dash-deployment/deploy4.jpg)\\n\\n  - You can even set up a CI/CD process with auto-deploys by playing with the auto-deploy section\\n![](img/dash-deployment/deploy5.jpg)\\n\\n  - You are all set ! Your app should be live ! \\n![](img/dash-deployment/deploy7.jpg)\\n  \\n\\n\\n#### Problems you can encounter\\n- Having your app not at the root of the repo, you can use subdir buildpack\\n- Not linking correctly your server in the Procfile\\n- Having difficulties to link with a database \\n\\n\\n:::tip \\n\\nIf your app does not work, you can check in the logs why it failed : \\n![](img/dash-deployment/deploy6.jpg)\\n\\n:::\\n\\n\\n\\n#### What Heroku is doing under the hood\\nHeroku does a lot for us actually. It detects the technology behind the web server pushed on Heroku (Python, Node, etc...). Looks for a Procfile with instructions on how to launch the server. And knows many things on how to set it up. \\n\\nFor example for Python servers, it will look first to find a ``requirements.txt`` file or ``pipenv.lock`` file. For a Node.js server it will look at the ``package.json`` and the lock file as well.  \\n\\n\\n### Deploying with Docker\\nIf you want to better master what you are deploying. You may want to use Docker. It\'s actually universal and you\'ll be able to deploy it almost anywhere.<br/>\\nI just google searched \\"Dockerfile Dash\\" and found a suitable example as a template https://github.com/jucyai/docker-dash/blob/master/Dockerfile<br/>\\nHow does it work? You will setup a virtually empty server with nothing but python 3.9 and the application, i.e a Container. \\n\\n```docker\\nFROM python:3.9\\n\\nENV DASH_DEBUG_MODE True\\nCOPY ./app /app\\nWORKDIR /app\\nRUN set -ex && \\\\\\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\\nEXPOSE 8050\\nCMD [\\"python\\", \\"app.py\\"]\\n```\\n\\nUsing this Dockerfile you could be able to deploy anywhere from GCP to Azure or even Heroku. \\n\\n## Going further\\nTo better deploy, it\'s always interesting to learn more about what you are manipulating. Here, you have to know that Dash is a wrapper for other technologies put together, and in particular:\\n- Flask as backend and server\\n- React as frontend\\n- Plotly (the python library) for most graphs\\n\\nIf you want to be a Deployment ninja \ud83d\udc31\u200d\ud83d\udc64, you may find useful to learn more about Flask and webservers in general. And eventually learn about React. \\n\\n### Adding databases\\nWhat is recommended is to avoid storing your database in the same server. You should approach the problem with a \\"microservice\\" mindset, meaning that you should put your database on another server. \\n- Indeed, it means you have to do another deployment, maybe using Docker again to expose your database correctly\\n- But, it also decouple your app in production with the database, allowing you for more modularity (requesting the database in other platforms)"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-15-welcome.md","title":"Welcome to the new Ekimetrics Tech website!","description":"Welcome to EkiLab website - the Ekimetrics technology & innovation blog and website!","date":"2021-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 15, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Ekimetrics","permalink":"/blog/tags/ekimetrics"}],"readingTime":1.32,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Pierre Biousse","title":"Data Science Manager","url":"mailto:inno@ekimetrics.com","key":"pierre.biousse"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome to the new Ekimetrics Tech website!","authors":["pierre.biousse"],"header_image_url":"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*yCcP_ZGS2mhlA9XnFFZDEw.jpeg","image":"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*yCcP_ZGS2mhlA9XnFFZDEw.jpeg","tags":["Ekimetrics"],"description":"Welcome to EkiLab website - the Ekimetrics technology & innovation blog and website!","keywords":["Data Science","EkiLab","Ekimetrics","Eki.Lab","Eki","Machine Learning","Artificial Intelligence"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Deploying a Python Dash application for beginners","permalink":"/blog/dash-deployment"}},"content":"<div align=\\"center\\">\\n\\n  ![screenshot-app ](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*yCcP_ZGS2mhlA9XnFFZDEw.jpeg )\\n  \\n</div>\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Welcome to our technology website!\\n\\n<div align=\\"justify\\"> \\n\\nWe have been working in the Data Science industry for 15 years and are now the biggest pure player in Europe with 250+ data profiles.
