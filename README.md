## The Lab

Our innovation lab is the first step in our R&D process.
- <span className="gold">State-of-the-art AI for business</span> - We study the state-of-the-art AI research straight from AI labs (Graph Neural Networks, Bayesian Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Structural Time Series modeling, Causality) to find ways to apply those techniques on unsolved business problems.  
- <span className="gold">AI For Good</span> - We challenge ourselves to always ensure a responsible use of Data and using our AI algorithms ethically. We research new ways of studying bias, enforcing algorithm transparency or maintaining Data privacy. We also do pro-bono research from climate change to epidemiological modeling. 
- <span className="gold">Data capabilities</span> - in an everchanging field, we need to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies to industrialize, scale, and operate our Data Science solutions. We research and implement connectors to deploy APIs in 5 mins, configure infrastructure-as-code, or facilitate the Data Science workflows with pre-industrialized templates
