## Our tech radar

Based on the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a>, and using the <a href="https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar">open-source implementation</a> popularized and developed by the great Zalando team, our Tech Radar sets out the technologies and tools we use at Ekimetrics for applied Data Science in our projects and solutions.
