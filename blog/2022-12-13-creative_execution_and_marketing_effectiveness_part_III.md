This article is **Part III** of a set of five technical articles that accompany a [whitepaper](https://ekimetrics.com/news-and-events/exploring-the-links-between-creative-execution-and-marketing-effectiveness-exclusivepreview) written in collaboration between Meta and Ekimetrics. Object Detection (OD) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) were used to detect specific features in creative images, such as faces, smiles, text, brand logos, etc. Then, in combination with impressions data, marketing mix models were used to investigate what objects, or combinations of objects in creative images in marketing campaigns, drive higher ROIs.
In this Part III we explore the methodology for using Tesseract to detect text in creative images.

## Detecting Text with Tesseract
<div align="justify"> 
Tesseract is an open-source optical character recognition (OCR) Engine that allows for the recognition of text characters within a digital image. It is an open-source resource, originally developed by Hewlett-Packard, and now managed by Google. This package does not have any parameters to optimise, but, as is exposed here, the basic performance of this resource can be improved with a combination of image processing and detected text correction. 

In this work, Tesseract was used to detect text in all images, in a process outlined in Figure 1. Performance of this detection tool was done using Confusion Matrices, to gain insight not only into the Accuracy, but also other metrics such as the True Positive and True Negative Rates.  
 </div>

Figure 1 - Three stage process by which the basic performance (accuracy) of Tesseract on the original images was improved by up to 28% points.

<br/>



<div align="justify"> 
To start with, the functionality was used on the original images to measure a baseline for performance on our sets of images. From this first step, we derived the following learnings:

- For general Text (both non-promotional Text and Promotional Text), the Accuracy is 69%, the True Positive Rate is around 65%, the False Positive Rate is about 35%.
- Tesseract does not recognise symbols such as % (which may indicate promotional text) accurately.
- Tesseract does not perform well on images that have a busy background.
- Tesseract does not recognise slanted Text.

Based on the low total volume of Promotional Text in our dataset, as well as the poor performance of Tesseract to detect Promotional Text, the decision was made to remove Promotional Text as one of the desired objects to study.

Building on those learnings, we implemented a pipeline, outlined in Figure 2, that would help us improve the performance from baseline, by up to 28 percentage points on Accuracy :

Figure 2 - Pipeline for pre-processing images before Optical Character Recognition Models, and correcting detected text.

 </div>
<br/>


<div align="justify"> 

For Step 1, pre-processing methods included the following, as well as combinations of those (illustrated in Figure 3): **Binary Threshold, Sharpen, Normalisation, Histogram Equalisation, Histogram Adaptive Equalisation**. As can be imagined, a processing method that enhances the performance of the detection method for one image, might decrease it for different images. Therefore, to ensure we obtained the highest accuracy for all images, we applied all pre-processing methods to all images, running Tesseract on each modified image, and keeping track of the text detected in each iteration.

<br/>


<div align="justify"> 
In Step 2 we use Tesseract to detect text in the pre-processed images. Step 3 consisted of removing any “incorrect” text, such as text inside the bounding boxes of Logo or Product objects, if the text was shorter than a threshold length (which depended on the brand), if it consisted of keywords, such as the brand name, or if it had ASCII characters. 

With the current methodology (figure 2), the accuracy cannot be improved any further by changing the length of text that is considered to be “true” Text. Furthermore, there is a trade-off between the True Negative Rate and the True Positive Rate, which helped us choose a threshold for the length of string to accept: Since Accuracy does not improve further after length 4, but this value does optimise the other two metrics, 4 characters long is the threshold chosen. 
 </div>


<br/>


<div align="justify"> 
The performance of Tesseract may be improved further by adding another step to the pipeline in figure 2, where the image is rotated several degrees, and after each rotation, text is detected. Due to time constraint issues, and the fact that we had already achieved a significant improvement above baseline and reached an accuracy of high 90s for some of the brands, we did not implement this step.
